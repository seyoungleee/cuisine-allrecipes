Yours is Pretty Good!  I am always looking for new ways to cook canned corned beef.    I usually tweak it a bit by omitting the potatoes and corn and adding in fried sweet plantanos,  1/2 cup of ketchup, 1 Sazon packet and a teaspoon of Adobo.  The bananas adds a little sweetness to the savory/saltiness and when put this over white rice.  Yummy!  This is one of my favorite Spanish dishes.

Very good

This is an excellent and very filling dinner. I followed the instructions other than adding more veggies (bigger potato, diced carrots, an onion, and a can of tomatos/corn/okra) and extra sofrito as a taste preference. I don't care for canned corned beef, but it sort of melts into the sauce. One could easily add more veggies, chicken, beef, simple and quick. I didn't bother to pre cook the potato, I just sauteed it with the onion and carrot and the potatos finished cooking in the sauce. This made about three and a half standard soup bowls worth. Tonight I'll add beef and more sauteed veggies yo stretch it into another meal. Thank you for sharing!

Delicious just as the recipe indicates but you can add whatever you have available and serve over fluffy white rice! yummm!

I use white wine instead of water.

Really quite nice. I didn't have sofrito but onions and garlic worked great suated together.

Good base and tasty. I replaced the potato with sweet potato. Also served with corn  frituras and omitted the corn from the stew.

I was looking for this can corn beef recipe for some time , this recipe tasted just like moms.  Loved it

Easy
