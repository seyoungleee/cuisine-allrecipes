Doesn't need anything else!

This is one of my favorite holiday drinks! I loved this version because it was egg-free, therefore it keeps much longer. Very creamy and just the right amount of cinnamon. My Puerto Rican boyfriend and his family gave this their stamp of approval. My only suggestion is to pour all the ingredients into a blender to make mixing easier.
