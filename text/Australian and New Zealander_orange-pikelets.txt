They are pretty good for having so little ingredients. I didn't have any self rising flour so I substituted 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in place of the last 2 tablespoons of flour. Definitely recommend! :)

Perfect quarantine food. No eggs? No problem! No milk? No problem!  I didn't even have orange juice, so I substituted cranberry-mango juice instead and was happy with the result.  Really good topped with blackberries.

Tasty little orange pancakes... I am not sure I understand having them with tea, which appears to be traditional but they taste nice
