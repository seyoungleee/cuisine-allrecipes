This has a refreshing taste...i had some problems with lumpiness and resolved by putting in the blender.  I used a bit of 1/2 and 1/2 for added depth.  Also i made some additions of cinnamon chips and scattered in a bit of coconut flakes. The coconut flakes were nice, but next time would do without the cinnamon chips.  Less is more in this pudding.  :0}

I think we have a problem with the instructions.  I thought the amount of cornstarch to be too large, but decided to follow to the letter (I allways do this the first time with any recipie.)  

Basicaly, it gelled in the pan before the cooking was complete.  It was the consistency of stuffing or bread pudding when we tried to get it out of the pan.  As it cooled, it got even firmer, finaly becoming a hard, starchy ball of glop (although very good tasting glop).

This recipie HAS to be wrong.  I've looked at some other ones, and am pretty convinced that it's not 2/3rds cup of starch, but 2 to 3 tablespoons of corn starch...

I'd like to hear other peoples experience with this as well.

Thanks!

I used plant-based milk and pistachios. Delicious!

I added saffron to the ingredients! Very persian!

Thanks Zahra

Super quick and easy to make! The ground almonds add a lovely texture. This pudding is jiggly and crunchy at the same time. I substituted coconut milk and a sprinkle of ground cardamom. I also used a generous splash of rose water, but the flavor did not come through.

I read through the other reviews before making it so i added 3 - 4 spoon of cornflour only and it yet tasted of too much corn flour. Maybe I personally do not like the taste of it but I didn't this recipe to be too good. Oh! And i skipped the rose water as I don't like the taste of it.

I think there should be FOUR cups of milk to that ratio of corn starch. another missing factor is 1 cup of rice flour that is dissovled in cold water and cooked while constantly stiring on medium heat until it becomes smoothe before everything else.  try this with the rice flour step first, then the correct mixture of cornstarch.  if you want to serve cold about two hours in the fridge should do.  good luck!

It was wonderful!

Perhaps this recipe was converted wrong. The traditional Persian version would use 1/4 c rice flour for the cornstarch, skip the other nuts and add a sprinkle of chopped pistachios on top. My mom used to serve it warm, no nuts, when we were sick.
