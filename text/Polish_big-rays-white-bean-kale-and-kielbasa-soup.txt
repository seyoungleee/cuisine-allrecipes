I loved it with 2 small changes. I added 2 cloves of garlic and simmered the kale mixture for about 10 minutes before adding the beans so that the beans didn't break down too much, but the kale was tender. Delicious!

This was simply delicious! I will make it again for sure!

I added diced tomatoes and mushrooms  a tbs of tomato paste and a quarter cup of red wine. We loved it

I made mine vegetarian by leaving out the sausage and using vegetarian broth   Delicious!!

We added carrots to the mix.

My husband made this soup but used a slow cooker instead.  It tastes phenomenal, is super healthy, and doesn't require expensive or difficult to find ingredients!

I added 4 baby red potatoes, and seasoned it with Thyme, Rosemary and red pepper flakes from my spice rack! I added the beans in the last 10 minutes. Every spoonful is flavorful! I also used low sodium chicken broth, which was plenty salty. Great way to use up kale!

It seemed a little bland, so I added about 15 oz of tomato sauce while it was cooking, and some elbow macaroni at the end.  Then it was delicious!  I cooked the beans for 1.5 hours like he said then combined the ingredients and put it in the slow cooker all day.

Super easy, flavorful, healthy meal. Used turkey kielbasa. Added garlic, 1/2 can of leftover diced tomatoes and some leftover arugula. (Waste not, want not). Delicious!

We love this soup with homemade rolls to dip!  I sear the  kielbasa in my cast iron skillet (without oil) until it's browned and crispy, then add it last.  I also sometimes add pasta (small macaroni) or tortellini to it for a heavier meal AND fresh chopped cherry tomatoes.  Very good!
