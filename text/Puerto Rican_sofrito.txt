My aunt owns a Puerto Rican store where she makes homemade sofrito to sell. The ingrdients posted are the same as hers and maybe not exactly like hers but it is AWESOME! Anyone who cooks with store bought jarred sofrito will be blown away by the homemade stuff. I absolutely refuse to buy the processed stuff anymore. I am very happy to see this recipe on this site!

Real puerto ricans dont use Cilantro, only Culantro. And no bell peppers. Use ajices dulces and ajitos

Good grief where has this been all my life!

Authentic! This recipe is spot on!  Thankfully, I did not have to substitute anything; I found ajies dulces and recao.  It is so good that I had to make a batch for my mother.  It has taken my beans to the next level.

This is so easy to make!
Its fresh, bright, and will be amazing in future meals!
I'm freezing mine in ice cube trays, then transferring to a ziploc bag to add into beans, soups, and Latin dishes :-)
Bonus!  It smells AMAZING!

Edited rating to reflect 5 stars -- not sure why I rated it 4 stars. I've made this recipe several times and just freeze in ice cube trays for later uses. I especially love using this recipe for sofrito along with the author's other recipes. There is another recipe for sofrito on this site, which is easier due to less ingredients, but although good, it does not compare in flavor to this one.

Love it fresh ready to eat.

Just like how grandma and mom made it.

Smelled wonderful in our kitchen while making this - taste is fantastic. Tried this on a beef stew, next I am going to roast a chicken with this. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Amazing! I have made this multiple times and it has always been a hit with both my Puerto Rican in-laws and my own family as well. We use it in many, many dishes. The possibilities are endless.

Less spices, try to make it for more people with the same food quality.
