This salsa is ambrosia, I like how even though the vegetables are pickled they still remain relatively crisp, when I make it I always use it as a condiment to Peruvian-Style Roasted Chicken. I always have left over salsa which I sometimes put on a sandwich or toss it into a salad.

This was ok. The flavor was extremely mild.
