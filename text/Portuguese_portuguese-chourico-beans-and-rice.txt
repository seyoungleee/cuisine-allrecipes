Please add 2-3 cloves of garlic finely chopped, when frying the onions and chourico. I have asked AR to modify the recipe as it was a mistake to be left out, but hasn't been edited. Enjoy! Also, a great alternative to fava beans are cannelini beans (white beans).

Quick and easy dish... I cooked the chourico in olive oil, removed it and left the drippings,  added diced onion with Portuguese all spice instead of Italian seasoning to the drippings, then the garlic.  I returned the chourico to the mix after 5 min then added the tomato sauce, black pepper and red pepper flakes.  Lastly I added white kidney beans for 2 minutes then served in a bowl over white rice.

I enjoyed this very much. I didn't have fava beans so I substituted black beans and since I had a red bell pepper in the fridge, I chopped that up and included it.

Very good! I actually left out the Italian seasoning but this was delicious will make again!

Wife loved it.  Like the OP said below, I think it would be better with the garlic added.

This certainly is comfort food!  I had to substitute kidney beans for the fava beans and some jarred spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce (didn't have all the ingredients in my cupboard).  It came out great!  Thanks for the recipe!
