I made this for our Seder, and it was absolutely excellent. I made a few very slight changes, but nothing drastic. Instead of peeling and chopping I grated the unpeeled apples using my food processor, which saved immensely on the prep time, and I left the peels on, since that's where most of the apple's nutrients are (buy organic if you're going to leave the peels on, though).  Also, I added a bit more honey (about 2 TBS total) to help bind everything together. To get three cups of grated apples I needed 5 smallish gala apples. I got several compliments on this, and two separate people told me it was the best haroset they'd ever had. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe tastes like unbaked pie filling to me.

This was very tasty. The only thing is I don't know anything about Jewish food. I made it first and then looked up some info about it. It is supposed to be more like a paste, so I wish the directions had been more specific. I liked the wine and other flavorings.

Loved this! I used 4 large honey crisp apples, more wine, and more cinnamon than recipe called for. My husband who claims he hates wine loved it!

I used a honey from Arizona (Thanks to my fabulous cousin!), raisins marinated in a Pinot Noir...(affordable,) later adding toasted almonds!

Pretty basic but serviceable haroset. Will probably make additions/modifications next time, but this works well as a base I think.

Delicious! I did not peel the apples,  but did chop them in the food processor. I also used slightly less wine than called for because we don't normally use alcohol products.  I will definitely make this again!

I used apple/grape juice and skipped the sugar. It turned out great.

Simple, easy! I did half pears, half apples!

No changes.  Apples were very big so I only used 5 and it was more than enough.
Very good.

I make this every year and it is delicious. I chop the apples rather fine and substitute some agave for the sugar.
