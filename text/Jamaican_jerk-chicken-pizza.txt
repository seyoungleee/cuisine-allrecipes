This is my recipe, but I noticed the All Recipes people changed it a bit. To let you all know who want to try it I used German salami which is spicy. I also did not put the salami on top of the chicken I put it on top of the sauce. If you want a really spicy pizza sometimes I will put a hint of the jerk sauce in the pizza sauce as well.

Not a scone, didnâ€™t love it

Family really liked it and the flavors were good. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I add cumin, cilantro, lime juice and coriander to the sauce and add mango and red onion to the toppings.

Used this as a base recipe! Very good, thanks.

This is a very good recipe and a great change from the norm.  I don't think that the step with broiling the bell peppers is really needed and adds more work to a recipe that already requires significant prep.  Great variety of flavors though!

This was so good.  I couldn't find jerk sauce so used jerk seasoning instead.  I also replaced the salami with bacon.  This is a nice change to your typical pizza recipe.

This was good!!!.  I made my own dough, used the exquisite pizza sauce fr this site.  I omitted mushrooms and salami but added pinapples, bacon and cheddard cheese on top of the mozorella. It came out tasteful.

This was great! And easy to make, too.  The only change I made was using already cooked chicken breast.

This was pretty good! I didn't have much time in the kitchen so I didn't roast and peel the green pepper, and I also used canned chicken breast meat. While the pizza was very tasty, it wasn't as jerk-y as I expected. If I made this again, I would probably use dry Jerk seasoning rather than sauce. Anyway, this was nice for a change. Thanks, Aimee!
