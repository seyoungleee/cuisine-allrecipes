The rose water is taste  a lot like perfume when made. Also why the cornstarch?

I did not make any changes to the recipe.  These turned out amazing and delicious. I will definitely make them again!!

I don't know about this recipe. They are definitely rose flavored gelees, but the texture is all wrong for Turkish delight. These were super dense like jello instead of soft and airy like Turkish delight. I found the flavor fine, but the texture inauthentic and unpleasant.
