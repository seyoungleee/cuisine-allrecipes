This is a wonderfully simple nut filling that is very adaptable. I used chopped walnuts and substituted brown sugar for the white suger and used this to fill mini tarts. Delisious!!

Also tried this with chopped pecans (didn't have walnuts) and it was great!

We tried this filling last Christmas and it was everybody's favorite!  Even the children preferred it over our usual jams.  Thanks!

Very easy to make and tasted great!

Super Easy & Delicious!
