This is a great recipe. I made it exactly as written. I love that it is made without corn syrup.

Made as the recipe states and used pre made tart shells and they turned out just as I like them. I put in the 1 TBSP of flour and raisins and they were great in between of set and oozing filling!!

I added very finely chopped bacon to these and they were delicious!

I love this recipe! The filling stays in the shells and tastes excellent.

Sooo good! Made the recipe exactly. Used premade sweet shortcrust pastry sheets in a cupcake tray. I made them for my New Zealand family and they were gone in a flash. I will definitely be making these again! Reminds me of home.

These are so easy and good. I leave out the flour as we like an "oozy" texture. I put a few raisins and some chopped nuts in the bottom of each shell.

Great recipe and I will make them again.

These are so darn good! I made some with raisins and some with pecans. Totally awesome! Huge hit! Thanks for sharing.

Yummy!!  I did add one Tbsp of apple cider vinegar to cut the sweetness a bit. Used frozen store bought shells and it made 30 tarts. Did some with raisins, some walnut, and some pecan...all were delicious.  Recipe is fast and easy. Will definitely make again

Oh yeah! Everyone loved them.
