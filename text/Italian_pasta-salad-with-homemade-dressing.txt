I looked up this recipe solely for the dressing.  This makes a lovely red vinegar dressing.  I use it with cold cooked pasta and a meat such as crabmeat or tuna.  Very tastey.

The dressing is delicious!! And my friends LOVED this salad. Though, I didn't use the mustard seeds.

Super yummy and simple dressing!

Made exactly to direction and was excellent!  Will make again- recipe yields plenty for potluck, cookout, etc.

I think it's a very clever twist on pasta, no pun intended!  I made some changes based on what I had on hand: shredded cheddar cheese plus red and green bell pepper, onion, olives and chickpea pasta since a member of the family is diabetic and that's the only kind of pasta which works for him.  I used my regular homemade "Italian" dressing which is very similar to what is in the recipe, and I am going to go pick fresh parsley to top it off while it's chilling!  I think he is really going to like this, as chickpea pasta becomes pasty when mixed with mayonnaise for traditional mac salad, and this is a welcome solution.

Great warm weather salad.  I used prosciutto and feta cheese instead of pepperoni and provolone.

Absolutely loved this salad! I didn't use the pepperoni sausage because my hubby doesn't eat meat and I used cubed cheddar cheese instead of provolone but everything else was as stated in the recipe and we both loved it!  Didn't even miss the meat and the cucumbers really added to the dish.  Thank you for the recipe!

I used a 16 oz. pack of rotini pasta, only used half the red onion, omitted the olives, and doubled the dressing.  It needed a tad bit more salt, otherwise it is delicious!

it's good

I can't have cucumber so I used celery.So everything else Excellent!!!!‚Å∞

It was good although I added some sugar to dressing
