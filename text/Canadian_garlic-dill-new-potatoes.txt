I used Idaho baking potatoes, cut in small pieces and put directly into crock pot.  Tossed potatoes with remaining ingredients and added a little olive oil for moisture.  Cooked until tender and the potatoes didn't fall apart.  Will definitely make again.

yummy

Really good flavor with the butter, garlic and dill. I did boil my potatoes instead of steam and they turned out great

I've made this recipe many times and just love it!  I've served it for a crowd and it's always the first side to go.There is no need to deviate from the original recipe, it's that good!

This was exactly what I was looking for, very good! Instead of new potatoes I used honey gold bite-sized potatoes and boiled them whole.  When they were done, I drained the water off and  cut them in half before pouring the seasoned butter over them.

9-14-22 Are you kidding me.?These took about 40 minutes to steam. Granted they were delicious, but time to prepare is way off.

Great flavor.  I substituted dry dill instead of fresh since that's what I had on hand. I would make these again and again.

I like to cut my potatoes pretty small since they aren't cooked with the dill and butter.  More flavor that way for me. Love them.

Excellent and easy!!

Excellent recipe and so easy and delicious! I recently resurrected my rice cooker that I rarely used. I've been steaming vegetables in it, which I used for these potatoes. I cut my very small red skinned potatoes in half, and it took a little longer than 10 min to steam. I made a small amount and used garlic powder, but I know fresh garlic will be much better. Thanks, and I know I will make this again!
