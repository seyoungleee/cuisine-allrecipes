I did a variation to this recipe and added a box of chocolate pudding.  It was great.  A moist cake. Froze easily also.

Not what I remember.  This recipe was very dry and that is with the addition of raisins.

I agree with some others that it seems a bit dry but the flavor is good. I used pecans and 1/2 can of fruit cocktail in place of the suggested walnuts, banana slices and raisins. The best part is that it gave me a reason to visit my neighbors.

This is day 6 of starter.  So far so good.

Very dry texture, but okay flavor. I'll stick to my recipe for Amish Cinnamon Friendship Bread.

I can't tell you how many times I've made this and it's never come out bad.  In my opinion, it's more like a pound cake.  You can add just about any of your favorite things...raisins, chocolate chips and nuts are only a few suggestions.  The pudding helps but I've left it out when I didn't have any.  It didn't ruin it at all.  And you can always freeze a cup of the "starter" for another time.  I've done this before and the end result still came out fine.  The fact that it makes 2 loaves, you can always share one.

Recipe  is somewhat ...what I remember.  Turned out good....but I was confused as to the total amount of flour for the whole recipe...cake seemed to dense

Delicious in taste and so much fun to make and share!

This is hard to rate, because it takes more than 1 day to complete...if you have the time and space it is a GRAT way to give to friends, and it is also, a great starter batter to make so many variations fo the cake....TASTE:  it is WONDERFUL,
and if there are young childern, it is fun to add the ingredients when they come home from school, and gives them a feeling of being a "BAKER" with PRIDE!!
I use this around the holidays..
