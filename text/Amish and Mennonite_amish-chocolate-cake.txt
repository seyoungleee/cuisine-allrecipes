I was a little nervous trying this with no posted reviews but so glad I did.  It is just as advertised.  Very moist and flavorful and baked beautifully.  Mine was done in 25 minutes but my oven tends to run hot.  I sifted powder sugar on the top after it cooled for about half hour.  Very easy and worth every bite!
