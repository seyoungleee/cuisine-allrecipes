Great recipe needs a little more salt and pepper - needs more rice - should be 2 cups not 1/2 cup; but GREAT RECIPE!

This is a nice scaled down version. There is no green pepper in the sofrito to start with and this is key.I think it needs more tomato and garlic.I use Spanish Bomba Rice and lobster stock as well as white wine.I also use scallops and lobster. I garnish with flat leaf parsley and piquillo peppers. Using a Paella Pan really does make a difference. It's hard to scale down Paella. When you make it it usually serves a crowd. I also sneak in a little finely minced celery. What can I say, I'm american. Thanks for Paella for two.

This paella was fantastic . The best I’ve ever made and the family loved it.

Pretty good! I didn't follow the recipe exactly though. Used fresh tomatoes (canned might have actually tasted better), forgot turmeric (not on purpose!), added a generous pinch of saffron, a tsp of rosemary, and used short-grain rice, and a mix of shrimp, calamari and mussels instead of just shrimp. All-in-all, pretty tasty!

I loved making this dish, so much fun! We all loved the finished product. I added more tomatoes, some red pepper flakes and snow peas instead of Romano beans because I couldn’t find Romano beans. Also, no one in my house wants squid so I substituted bay scallops which were super!

Yes, this will become a regular at our table. I made the recipe with out changes

It was GREAT! I made a few changes, useing what I had. Added Whitefish and used chicken broth.
