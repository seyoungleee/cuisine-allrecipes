Absolutely delicious! I love Persian food and don't get to have it very often. These kabobs will become a staple in my house.  I marinated the meat for about 8 hours. I would probably go a little less next time. While the flavor was amazing, the acidic citrus juices were just starting to "cook"/toughen the chicken. I served the kabobs with saffron rice, grilled tomatoes and onion. YUM!
