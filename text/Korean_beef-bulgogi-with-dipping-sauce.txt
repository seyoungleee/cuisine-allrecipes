Made as written and I have no complaints. It's not the best Bulgogi I have ever had but it is still really good and for how simple it was I'm giving it a 5 star. I started out dipping the beef in the sauce but that was awkward with the rice and ended up dumping it over the entire dish and that worked better. I did cook my beef longer because I like a dark brown on Bulgogi. The longer it goes the more tender it gets and the sugar puts a deep rich brown on it. Definitely a keeper and one I would make again.
