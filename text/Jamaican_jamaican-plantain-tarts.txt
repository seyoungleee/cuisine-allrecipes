OH MY GOSH!!!! I have been looking for a plantain tart recipe for a minute!!!  MY husband loves, loves, loves platain tarts. Now that we live in Nevada, it is very hard to find West Indian restaurants.  Anyway, tried the recipe and presented to my dh.  He asked me what restaurant I bought them from...need I say more?

The dough was crumbly and could not be rolled. I had to add an egg and some more butter to it. The tart ended up very bland and not sweet at all.

Excellent recipe and great taste!!

I made this and it came out perfectly!! Just as I remembered from childhood.  I was worried because I used less flour and more water in the dough that the ingredients recommended. It came out perfectly tho. I let it bake for about 35 minutes. Came out great!

Filling is delicious but pastry was a chore to roll out! after hours  in the fridge was difficult to roll and kept tearing. Realized less tearing if I rolled the pastry a bit thicker.made about 12 not 24.

The filling needed cinnamon.  The pastry, TERRIBLE.

The plantain filling was perfectly balanced in flavour, no additional sugar was required. Lots of compliments!

Loved it.

I love it! I switched things up by using store brought discos de enpanadas. I cut the enpanada disc in half fried them let cool and sprinkled w powder sugar. Absolutely delicious!

Wanted a taste of home and this did the trick. I did add a splash of white rum and cinnamon, so good.

Great recipe! But to get the plantain filling the customary pink that is the tradition, use way more red colouring - 10 drops for 3 plantains is about right.
