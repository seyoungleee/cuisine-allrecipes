Great recipe!  I made it just as written and was wonderful!  
Then I  did some experimentations.  I used coconut oil instead  of vegetable oil, 3 eggs, 3 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 c brown sugar since we don’t like too sweet and greased the pan with coconut oil.  I’ve added in raisins, blueberries, and chocolate chips at different times and all were wonderful. Just as written is fantastic and is also easy to try different variations!

Absolutely delicious, and the texture is incredible! (I used quick oats) even if you don’t like oatmeal, you’ll enjoy this. Only problem is, It’s sweet enough to be considered dessert. I’m going to try cutting the sugar in half next time and add a drizzle of honey or syrup if needed.I added freeze dried apples, with enough extra water to reconstitute, and it turned out amazing.

Love this recipe. Made some changes as I didn't have brown sugar, so I used 1/2 cup maple syryp, 3 eggs and butter instead of oil. I also added vanilla extract. What a wonderful recipe. Very filling. I add nuts and blueberries when I serve it. Tastes like an oatmeal cookie.

Super tasty! I added blueberries and some chopped nuts! Will be my go to! Another friend sent me this recipe that he uses and his was wonderful too! Thanks for sharing!

4.6.20 This is good stuff, very filling!  Took out of the oven at 25 minutes, and it was just a bit on the dry side, so I might check for doneness sooner the next time.  Not a major problem because a little milk drizzled over the top did the trick.  Super easy to make, not too sweet, and a hint of cinnamon never hurts.  Thanks for sharing this B&B’s breakfast recipe, we enjoyed it.
