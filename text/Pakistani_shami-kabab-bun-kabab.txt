Made as written and my rating for taste is a 5. My rating for execution is a 2. These start out frying up nicely  but before it is even time to flip they completely fell apart into one big crumble  in the skillet. I never touched or moved them but they just fell apart into one big pile of crumbly mush and  I even added flour.  After they were cooked thru and cooled I was able to smash them back into shape but it wasn't an easy task nor was it pretty. Sorry but as written these did not work for me. I really liked the taste so I might try to tweak them to see if I can't make them work again.

These were SO GOOD. I added flour like the chefs note said, and I probably should have used peanut oil because mine got too brown too quickly- but we ate them with raita and they were devoured within minutes. Our kids loved them too!

I cut the recipe in half and omitted the red chili pepper, otherwise made it as is written. My meat remained too moist and crumbled before cooking so I added flour per the cook's notes. They held together fine during browning but were fragile and required 2 spatulas to flip over.
