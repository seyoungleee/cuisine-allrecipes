sooo good! especially when you first take them out of the oven, they're just like air. I added 1/2 Teaspoon of vanilla extract. To keep the jam from spreading all over the cookie, just make small thumbprints!  I am only 12 so i may not be that much help...but my whole family loved them and asked me to make more!

I followed the recipe exactly but ended up with extremely flat, *very* buttery cookies.  They were similar to Irish lace cookies in texture and flavor (minus the oats and with jam on top).  I think next time I'll halve the butter and see if it holds up better to baking.  The flavor is pretty good, though a little too buttery.

Delicious! I added some lemon zest to the dough and used blueberry preserves.

Do not bother. It tastes terrible. I would consider myself a pretty experienced at-home baker, and I have never made something that I would not eat. Do not make.

My wife and coworkers loved this recipe, made it exactly as is with raspberry Jam.

Guess i need more practice,but it's the first time making them.

It was so delicious I used marmalade

Loved it, tasty  and easy to make

These simple cookies were delicious! I made them with raspberry preserves and my family loved them. IMO best about twenty minutes to a half hour after taking them out of the oven. The jam is able to cool down, but it's still nice and soft :)

So easy and so good. I’ve made them 3 times (I make them a dozen at a time) with different fillings. This last time, I added lemon peel, juice and extract. They are super bright and have a wonderful flavor contrast. I’ll probably try almond extract next time.

My new favorite cookie, and there is no chocolate involved!  These are so light and the flavor and texture is perfect.
