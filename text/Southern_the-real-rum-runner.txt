This is a good recipe, although I did tweak it a bit.  I cut the pineapple and orange juices down to  3/4 oz and added 3/4 oz pomegranate juice. I also added 1/2 oz fresh lime juice.  This cocktail really benefits from it's addition.  I was going to add a dash of grenadine, bit forgot. It was fine without it; the pomegranate juice added the right flavor, without too much sweetness, although the color of the drink probably would have been more attractive with it.  I also didn't bother with the 151 rum, the other rums were enough for me.

This drink is a little fussy to make but when it is done you have a classic tropical treat to share with your guests or for a special occasion that will impress. The taste is delicious but beware, these will sneak up on you and are very powerful. Enjoy in moderation, but enjoy!

I absolutely love it. It was a challenge finding the blackberry liquor/brandy. Fantastic drink to share with your friends on a summer day. ‚ù§Ô∏èüçπ

This, this is a faithful recipe.  I'd take out some ice unless you wanna be drinking just water.

Very good, simple recipe for rum runners. I find that the banana liquor easily overpowers some of the other components, but it's easily corrected by adjusting amounts. Find what works for you!
