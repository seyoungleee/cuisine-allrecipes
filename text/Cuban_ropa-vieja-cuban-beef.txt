love this recipe

I always visit this delicious Cuban diner in Miami, because their food is amazingâ€¦ this tastes just like it!

Excellent .

Absolutely delicious!  It reminds us of the fabulous Cuban meals we had in Miami.  I serve it with seasoned black beans & rice and my whole family loves it.

Excellent bold flavor!  It is worth it to add all the different spices.  Instead of simmering on the stovetop for 2 hours, I put in the slow cooker on high. (This felt safer).  
     Has anyone tried with red wine vs white? I wonder how that would change the flavor profile. 
     Makes lots of sauce. I used the leftover sauce when I made instant rice; this created a kind of Spanish rice (Cuban rice)

Delicious!! Made it exactly according to Chef Johns directions and it turned out fantastic! This is going in my meal rotation!

I will never use another recipe for this dish again! Absolute perfection. Was tempted to skip overnight refrigeration because the house smelled so good! Glad I didn't. I left out the sugar that was it.

We loved it so much! We followed the recipe exactly and it came out soooooo delicious. We are huge fans of Chef John.

Absolutely delicious.  Nice blend of flavors - spicy without sacrificing taste.  Another gem from Chef John!

It was so good! We used London Broil for the meat, and the flavor was fantastic.
