We loved this!  Instead of the stovetop method -I first boiled the sausage for about 10 minutes and then I through all of the ingredients together in my slow cooker and let the flavors meld together on low for 8 hours...YUMMY!  Served it over rice with veggies on the side.  So good we wish we had more sausage in the house to make it again tomorrow!  Will do again and again...

This was good. The sauce had great flavor. To me, this recipe is best served as a party dish - done in the crock pot.
