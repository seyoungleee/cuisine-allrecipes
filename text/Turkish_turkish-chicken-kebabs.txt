This was truly delicious and savory. I skipped the cinnamon, however, I think that changes the taste a bit. I also made it with chicken breast which one would think would be dry, but still turned out juicy.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe. 10/10 Made for friends and said itâ€™s the best meal they have had in years!

Tasted really good, not sure you should use greek yogurt in a turkish dish..

This recipe was easy and most importantly delicious!  Moist and flavorful, my whole family loved it!  I used standard crushed red pepper and it was not too hot but jut enough heat!

My wife is generally not a fan of foreign cuisine,.particularly from the Middle East or the Mediterranean but she absolutely raved about this one!  I have to agree, it is a stellar recipe. Turkish or just close, thanks Chef John!

We really enjoyed this although I did only put a tsp of salt in.  I wonder if the TBSP is a misprint.  Very tender and the flavor is unlike anything we have had before.  Will make again.

My entire family loved this recipe and came back for seconds.

I must say, this dish is truly delectable! Personally, I tend to complement it with Piyaz for a wholesome and gratifying meal.

This has been one of our go-to recipes for entertaining for years.  We always get many compliments and have passed on the recipe several times.  We always make extra chicken and sauce and freeze it.  The sauce is amazing.   I also make tofu along with the chicken and the sauce pairs nicely with tofu as well.   Make this recipe!

I've made this recipe several times and love it. I only add some ground cloves to the marinade and fresh cilantro when I serve it.  My favorite chicken kebab! Thank you so much for sharing it.
