The durian flavour comes out well!  Although my Malaysian wife and her family were quite repelled at the idea of durian in a cheesecake, I thought it tasted not bad at all.  Durian is definitely an acquired taste and this is a good way to try it.  Mine also didn't turn out quite as yellow as the picture submitted with the recipe.

Absolutely delicious asian-style cheesecake. Super simple to make but really impressed with the outcome and glad to find this recipe was available online!

i tried.. so deliciuos.. but i used pastrypuff to wrap it up
