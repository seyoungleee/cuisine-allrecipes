When I put the batter in the pan, it was insufficient to cover the bottom of the pan, so I quickly made another recipe of batter to add on top. It took almost twice as long to bake, but was wonderful! 10/10!! Love it!

Very delicious. Loved the cinnamon sugar topping. Will definitely make this again.

We made it gluten free by using g.f self raising flour and low fat olive spread! Worked out beautifully!
