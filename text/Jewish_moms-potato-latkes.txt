This is my recipe. I wanted to let folks know that before you put the potato mixture in the pan, take the scoop and make sure to drain the liquid out by holding the spoonful of potato against the side if the bowl.  Also we usually crush the saltines in a Baggie, saves on mess. The saltines act as a binder. Hope you love these as much as we do. My favorite way to eat them is with sour cream. The don't reheat well in microwave (in my experience) but do reheat fairly well in a toaster oven.

I did not have saltines, so used flour and increased the salt. Added some garlic too.

This was my first time making potato pancakes, and it was wonderful! I had to fight my husband off for the last couple on the plate! This recipe is going into my regular rotation. Thank you for sharing!

oh so good

I substituted the crackers for crushed stale potato chips!

This recipe is my first experience with latkes and I absolutely loved their delicious simplicity. I've made them twice now. The only variation I did from the recipe is dabbing up excessive moisture from the potatoes with paper towels, but even so it requires squeezing off excess fluid with a spoon.

They came out perfect.  I substituted panko bread crumbs for the crackers.

Very good and easy to make.

These were very good.

Super easy recipe to follow. I didn't have saltines on hand so I went with some panko breadcrumbs.  I used and icecream scoop to have uniform size. I grated the small onion and also used some dry onion powder, garlic powder along with the salt and pepper.  Pressed them down so they were nice and flat and fried away. Had exactly 10 perfect latkes with great flavor.

I made the recipe as is except that I used a big boiled Idaho potato leftover that I shredded. I must say that it was a good recipe to use up the potato. I do not think I would make any changes to the recipe.
