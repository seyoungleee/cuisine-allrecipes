Everyone enjoyed this recipe as a great side dish!  I modified it to make it a bit healthier by cooking the onions, celery, and garlic in 1/4 cup vegetable broth, instead of the butter, and it came out great.  Thanks for a quick and easy addition to any meal!

This was good to me, but my husband wasn't lovin it. If you like cabbage, I think you'll like this though. I found that it didn't taste near as good the next day. For the summer time, however, this is a good healthy dish to go to.

This was a great change for my cabbage I added a can of  RoTel mild diced Tomatoes and green chillies and diced smoked sausages   I added extra seasonings and 2 tbs of white vinegar. It was delicious I will make it again I made it for Sunday dinner!!

Sauteed cabbage, potatoes and bacon or sausage is one of the easiest and most delicious recipes you can make but I really wanted something healthier and I really love cabbage so this hit the spot for me. Thank you for the delicious recipe.

Excellent Side Dish for Pork or Corned Beef, anything really!

I loved this recipe. It was simple and delicious. A recipe you can add to it if you like.

very good flavor with the stewed tomatos!

Surprisingly delicious for how simple it is! Definitely saving this recipe.

Remarkably delicious!

This was fantastic.  But I did add some ground beef to it.  If you have ever had galuskis or cabbage rolls, this tastes quite a bit like it, but without all the work!

Great flavor, simple to make, warm & filling comfort food
