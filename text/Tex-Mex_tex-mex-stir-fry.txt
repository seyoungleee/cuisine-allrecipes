My family loved this recipe. Only changes I made include the following: instead of a green bell pepper I used a yellow bell pepper, also my son put his in a flour tortilla wrap - then everyone else did the same. It was great either way. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great taste, we are vegetarian so I used tofu instead. Also threw in some corn and purple onion. So versatile, you can improvise and it will work well. We have served it over chips and it made delicious nachos.

Used pineapple salsa to add some subtle sweetness

Easy and fast flavorful dinner. I added a chopped onion to the peppers, using all green ones. Then added a little frozen corn and sliced tomatoes. Simmered for about 10 min. Served with potato wedges and a green salad.

We didn't have any green peppers, but we did have some broccoli we needed to use, so we steamed that for a bit and threw it in. Not very Tex-Mex, but it was just fine. 

Our college boys are coming home this weekend - so we're thinking about a double batch and trying it again. My wife and I both really liked it.

Simple and delicious! I used a chicken taco seasoning packet, and a jarred habanero salsa.  It is great in a tortilla, but I liked it better over rice with a squeeze of fresh lime juice.

We loved this but I did make some changes. I added onion, garlic and chili powder to the pepper mixture and used at least a cup of salsa. We ate it with chips, sour cream and avocado. Pickled jalape√±os were also good on it.

This was a great quick to make dish! I added some corn to make it a bit more Mexican. I couldn't  figure out what it was lacking, but my boyfriend said it needed a but of crunch. Next up

My family loved this. Only change I added mushrooms. I added Mexican rice and hit a home run

just finished eating !!!  awesome flavors will have again and again !! thanks !!
