This was AMAZING! I'd give it 6 stars if I could. I ended up pressing mine. I melted some butter in a pan and pressed it down with my iron skillet on top. 3 minutes on both sides over medium heat. DO NOT SKIP THAT STEP! It takes this sandwich to a whole other level. After a few bites I swapped the pickles for banana peppers and it was even better!

This is a great recipe! I added a slice of deli ham and jalape√±o peppers, then broiled it open-faced to melt the cheese a little. Be sure to add salt and pepper. Very easy and delicious!
