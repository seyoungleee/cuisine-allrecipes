This was tremendously simple to make and that is always a plus as we get older!  It was perfect made exactly as directed and we all enjoyed it.  As in much of the Amish cooking I experience and do (yes, my best friends are Amish), there is very little spicing involved.  I actually enjoy the bell pepper providing a lot of the flavor but you could also add anything you like- paprika was a good addition on my second go-round and if you use hot paprika, even better!  Very enjoyable.

Okay recipe. I jazzed it up by adding crushed red pepper, Italian seasoning and garlic powder.

Five stars indeed! This contains simple  items and is very easy to make. I forgot to get green pepper so I used roasted red peppers instead. The taste is great. Will be a repeat recipe for sure.
