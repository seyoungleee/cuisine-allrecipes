I made this and another ground turkey taco filling recipe and this one was by far the better recipe. It is super simple, filling, and bursting with flavor. The only change I would make next time is to use fresh jalapeno in place of the bell pepper. Don't skip the tomatillo sauce. It compliments ground turkey perfectly.

I made a few changes -- but it's that kind of recipe, adjustable to taste. The major change was replacing the rice with another can of beans (pinto) and mashing them up some (a can of refritos would work, but I prefer the beans just partially mashed). Jalapenos instead of green chilis and more seasoning are more to my taste, but it's really up to your taste buds.

This was delicious. I had to use jalapenos since I didn't have green chilis, but it worked great. I also did not have brown rice so I used white. I will do this again. Such a good recipe with a lot of flavor. Also, it was easy to make after a long day at work.

These are delicious.  I had to omit the garlic due to an allergy and I used red rice instead of brown because it is what I had available.  I topped these with pomegranate salsa and chopped lettuce and served them with fresh fruit.  They were fantastic.
