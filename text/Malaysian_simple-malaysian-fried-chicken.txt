This recipe is also good prepared with boneless chicken breasts, marinated overnight and then broiled.

I wasn't impressed, but my husband loved it.

Omg this recipe is so easy and simple I Love it. It turned out good with so much flavor. I used mince garlic instead from Costco and it turned out just fine. Thanks for sharing!

I made it as published....it was ok...

I always follow recipes exactly first, then work out if it needs anything.  This one doesn't! It was delicious and it's a keeper.  So simple but tasty. Loved it!!

Iâ€™ve had Malaysian fried chicken in Malaysia. This is not what it taste like. Not much flavor. Chicken tasted good though.

Used soy sauce and sesame oil as I didn't have oyster sauce on hand. Added cayenne, paprika, Chinese five spice, garam masala, ginger and doubled the garlic. Fantastic!

Made this tonight since I hadn't done grocery shopping and it was so simple. MY FAMILY LOVED IT! It's now on of their favorite foods and my husband suggested I put it in the recipe book of family favorites that they would be willing to eat often. I did add some red pepper to give it a bit of a kick but I have a feeling that it would be great without it.

so easy so yummy . I made mine crunchy on the outside. juicy on the inside .

The curry powder, oyster sauce, and garlic combo is a great and quick marinade! I used it on pork and chicken. My family loves this!!

Absolutely fantastic recipe. Easy to make and doesn't make a mess of the kitchen. Just signed up for an account to rate this. Changes I made : Added garlic paste instead of chopped garlic, added a touch of cayenne pepper and people who want little more sweeter chicken can add a tsp of sugar too. I used chicken wings and it was amazingly good. Thanks for this recipe :)
