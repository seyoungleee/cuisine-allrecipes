I chose to make these open like a tart. I added two small hatch chilis to the corn mixture. The presentation was very nice and the taste of the corn mixture was very good. The empanada rounds browned nicely but unfortunately they were hard and dry.

Almost too good! I couldn't stop eating them. I even left out the green onions as I happened to have forgotten them on my last shopping trip. But I bet they'd taste yummier with. The only reason this has 4 stars and not 5 is that they do not make me feel very full which is a large part of the reason I ate like way too many.

I made this in muffin tins rather than closed and I couldn’t find empanada rounds so I made a pie crust instead. I’ve since found a recipe for empanada dough, but the pie crust worked very well and they were delicious.

Delicious! I made the filling as written. I rolled out empanada rounds, cut them into fourths and put them into mini muffin tins. Perfect! I think it would also be delicious with phyllo cups.
