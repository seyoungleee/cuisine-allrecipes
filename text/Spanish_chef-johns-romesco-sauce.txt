So good! Followed it almost exactly (peppers took longer to blacken but this was also my first time). Ate it on bread with cucumber, feta, and rotisserie chicken for about a week. I will definitely be making this again!

I love this recipe, my wife loves this recipe. This is good as is no changes necessary. It is excellent as a sauce on most meats because the depth of flavor can stand up to anything and enhance it. My wife eats it by the spoonful when my back is turned. I highly recommend this recipe.

Easy to make and full of flavor

only used 4 garlic, added a jalepeno and a chipotle/adobo, added some canola to smoothen it

Wonderful!!!
