A very nice Chicken Curry.  I also used 1 tsp. of Garam Masala.  I wish I had left out the lemon and the cayenne because I thought it tasted better before those were added.  I even cut down the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. because my youngest daughter doesn't like it too hot.  I think that next time I will omit the last two ingredients.

I did not care for this recipe. My husband is Indian and he took one bite and was done. I have been cooking Indian for 14 years and this is not it. I will continue with my in-laws' version instead. I will post that recipe soon. Sorry to leave negative feedback.
