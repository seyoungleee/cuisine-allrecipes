I come from a Mennonite family. I love RollKuchen! Our favorite way to enjoy them is dipped in jam (any flavour) or corn syrup. Thank you for sharing a part of mennonite cuisine with the world :)

I think the recipe needs adjustment. I added the correct amount of eggs but had to add 3 more cups of flour for the dough to not be incredibly sticky. It also only made 18 pieces after I doubled the recipe and added the extra cups of flour. Mine didn't get very fluffy either.

These are very close to the ones my mom used to make when I was a kid!  I haven't had them in years!  I don't know if anyone else ever did this but we used to dip them in white vinegar mixed into a paste with sugar.  I know it sounds wierd but my mouth is watering just thinking about it!!  Yum!

I just love Rollkuchen and hadn't made it in years.  When in Belize we ordered fry jacks and to my pleasure it was what they called Rollkuchen so every morning for breakfast I had that with watermelon for breakfast.

It tastes really good with honey and watermelon!

being from a Mennonite background, this was one of my favorites at my grandmas during the summer. we often ate them fresh and with syrup, as well as with watermelon... yumm!
