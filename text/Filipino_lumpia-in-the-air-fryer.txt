delicious, definitely going to make this again. Best of all, it's easy to follow.

Made this with ground pork. I did run all of the vegetables through the food processor including the garlic. Started with the carrots and added progressively to the softer vegetables. So the carrots ran through several cycles but the water chestnuts only had 1 cycle. I had fresh ginger root on hand so used about an inch instead of the ground. As others said, I didn't have avocado oil so brushed with peanut oil before air frying. Delicious! Wife said that I need to make these again. Definitely company worthy.

Pretty good! The kids liked it! And yes it was crispy-I didnâ€™t have avocado oil and mine was still crispy.

delicious, definitely going to make this again. Best of all, it's easy to follow.
