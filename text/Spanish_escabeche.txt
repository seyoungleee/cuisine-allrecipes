nice. i try in a party and all my friends like it .......hummmmmmm

Did not like this. First time I ever had gizzards and I doubt I'll ever eat them again.

The only difference is the I upped the amount, (big familyüòÅ) and since I couldn't find the right green bananas I did use the green plantains. Still tasted great, but if you know the difference, then you could tell ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I make this all the time. I buy it at stop n shop and for good size package $3.00 and that‚Äôs a good deal. I make it with bananas or without and I do without because my husband can‚Äôt have bananas due to CKD and he loves it over rice . They eat 3 dishes per person that‚Äôs how much they love it .

Great recipe my husband loves this dish my first time making it. I would just cut the vinegar Dow to just 1 cup! Overall great

Instructions not clear.

Although I do not eat this I have made it twice for the holidays for family and friends, and they all love it! I actually put my own twist to it with the seasoning..so this might make a big difference in the preparation. I wanted to add my own recipe on the app, but I have no clue on how to do it. Good luck!
