We loved this dish! I'm ten and I made this for my family. It was so easy to do that I would do it again every night!!!!! We did not tomato paste so we used a jar of pizza quick sauce which worked great!

Not sure how to rate this.  We didn't love it as Ratatoulli but I blended it up and added tomato sauce I made from our garden tomatoes, let it simmer all afternoon and served it as sauce over spaghetti and the entire family LOVED it.  "Best sauce ever mom"... don't tell the kids its the same we had for dinner last night!!

lovely recipe! we made it with vegetables from our own garden.

Delicious and although time consuming, not difficult. My 16 year old made it himself.

This was delicious. Absolute favorite now.

Labor of love and it was excellent. Had it over pasta and the mascarpone was an awesome touch.

Love this dish.  It's one of my favorites. Made no adjustments to the recipe.

We made this tonight two different ways. They are both good, but we found that using  tomato sauce made the veggies more tender and less mush like. We used minced garlic(a half table spoon), Tuscan seasoning, pepper, salt, and fresh thyme for the sauce. This is definitely a good recipe to try and tweak to your liking.

This was a 5/5 we have made this dish many times adding other veggies such as slices of purple onion and cremini mushrooms- rather than drizzle olive oil over top I lightly brush one side of the cut veggies with garlic and olive oil mix, I do not put any cheese on at all while baking but sprinkle  Parmesan over top when serving.   Itâ€™s an easy and delicious dish

I love this recipe, but make a few changes. I add sliced tofu and mushrooms instead of eggplant, sprinkle with parmesan and mozarella, serve it over quinoa for extra protein

Amazing!  Added Sun-dried tomato and olive pesto instead of the tomato paste!
