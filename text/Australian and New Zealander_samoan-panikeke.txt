I can't thank you enough for this recipe.  My five  year old grandson is allergic to milk products, eggs, corn and chicken. We live in a very rural community without the luxury of large supermarkets or health food stores.   We have to be very careful with reading ingredients and substituting in recipes.  Finding "treat" recipes for him that acutally taste good and don't have a weird texture has not been easy.  So until I tried these, he had never had a doughnut.  And these are terrific.  Even his cousins who usually turn their noses at "Parker proof" treats, loved these sprinkled with a little powdered sugar.  The second time I made them, we added a little cinnamon to the batter and they are like a banana bread donut.  I plan on trying other fruits like applesauce and pumpkin in the future.  Thank you so very much for sharing.

Exact measurement of the listed ingredients does not yield the thick, sticky dough intended. It yields a batter with the consistency of a thick soup. I've had to keep adding flour and some more baking powder in order to 'fix' the recipe the best I could.

Quite an easy recipe and tasted delicious.  I used the Pampered Chef Batter Mixer and Dispenser and it was a game changer! No mess!

Brings me back to my childhood! Such a great Recipe!

Wow they are awesome. My kids ❤  them.

They burn way too fast and way too easily.

Absolutely love the recipe! I make it alll the time and everyone that tries them loves them too. The only thing that’s a struggle is getting the right temperature if you don’t have a thermometer. But once you get that right it’s easy!

Thanks for the recipe. I love Samoan panikeke and wanted to make dessert for my parents and my own family after Sunday dinner. Mine turned out really well. I didn't have any banans on me, so I used a can of crushed pineapple instead. I could've made this plain too, but I wanted a little fruity sweetness, and the crushed pineapple did the trick in lieu of bananas.

Changes we made in order to get a successful panikeke:
- Added a 3rd mashed banana.
- Used a candy/frying thermometer to maintain temp around 350F. Without thermometer, we were frying too hot and getting burnt exterior + raw interior.
- Squeezed dough out of hand to get a more ball shape, like how andagi is made.
- Fried 5min30sec per side. Less than that resulted in raw centers.
- Incorporated 3/4 to 1cup wheat flour just for kicks.
- Used closer to 1cup water and/or added more flour if mixture was too runny.

Ours came out pretty dark (like this pic), but the shell was not too thick, nor did it taste burnt. Inside was cooked and moist.

Great, easy to work with.

The recipe did was fantastic however it was not the doughy consistency needed. I ended up adding another 50% of the dry mixture to make it thick enough to make into fritters. Absolutely delicious thorough!
