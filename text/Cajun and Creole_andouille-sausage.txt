Instead of using the casings to make sausage, I bought a plastic hamburg maker ($4) and make sausage patties.It's a lot easier to deal with than the casings are! I think casings are more "tradition" than useful, now with refrigeration as it is today! I discouvered for the most part, I remove the casings when I use sausage anyhow... It's also easier for making sandwiches!   
Good Recipe!'

This is not smoked?!?!?  I thought Audouille was a smoked sausage.

We used Boston Butt instead of the meat mix and used the spices for 5lbs. We also added 1cup of chilled Milk Stout. Very nice recipe!!!

This recipe is great. You can Buy Andouille Sausage and have it delivered anywhere in the United States.

Really good. Some recipes add pink salt but this is tasty and more like bratwurst (fresher).

Cut the salt by half.  And cut the smoke by half.

They are easy to make, and delicious, Excellent.

Really good sausage, with just the right kick.  I reduced the amount of liquid smoke a little bit, because I had some bacon fat, and used it here.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  I will make again, for sure!

Went over very well with my husband he even asked for more

these are great I will be smoking half of them so I used less liquid smoke. defiantly will repeat

Recipe is solids.  I added the proper amount of cure and then smoked the sausages.  Turned out great.
