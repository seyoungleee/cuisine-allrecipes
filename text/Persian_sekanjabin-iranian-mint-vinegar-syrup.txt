This "Sekanjabin" recipe is for a syrup which can be used to make a drink (sharbat-e sekanjabin). Iranians like to dip lettuce leaves in the undiluted syrup as well for a refreshing summer snack. Thank you Desert Damsel for sharing your recipe.

This was very good, and very reminiscent of the "shrub" drinks of "olden times".

Well done
Exactly we eat Secanjabin with lettuce leaves

I replaced the Mint with 2 cups of Rose petals, and simmered them in the pot for 20 minutes, then strained them out.
