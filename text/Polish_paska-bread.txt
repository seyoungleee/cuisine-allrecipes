Of all the Paska recipies I have tried this one has turned out the best quality bread. The quanity made it a little difficult to work with my kitchenaid mixer, but that was minor compared to the quality. I would recommend this to anyone. Just make 2/3 of recipe to manage better.

The bread looked beautiful, but just did not have any flavor, sorry.

This isn't as sweet as other paska bread before you put on the glaze. I put in one TABLESPOON of salt for this much flour to give it flavor.  If you want a sweet bread,  double the sugar.  Be fair warned, it raises like a Martian mushroom and is wonderfully fragrant baking.

Flavor and texture was great. I added dried fruit & a bit of powdered sugar glaze on top to finish it off. Delicious!

Excellent recipe.  The dough was beautiful to work with and it made 4 huge loaves.  The taste is exactly like my Slovak grandmother used to make.  Thank you for sharing.

I love this recipe!  I make it every Easter.  I use 12 cups total of flour, 4 for the sponge and 8 for the dough.

This is pretty close to what my Ukrainian grandmother made every Easter, except we bake it in coffee cans!

12 cups of flour total or for dough only?  I  added  8cups and stopped because the dough would not take more. I would add more sugar instead. The taste is like a bread, no flavor.It was good for pirojki with cabbage.

I had to cut the recipe in half.  Nothing wrong there.  However, the result was tasteless.  Needless to say, I thought it was disappointing.

Excellent recipe, but I would cut it in 1/2.

I made this for Easter it made plenty I did cut the flour by 3 cups and I added 2 more cups of sugar it came out perfect and for the top I used 1 egg and 4tsp of sugar just for a sweeter taste I will definitely make it again Thank u ;)
