Can't wait to try your other pickerel recipe!

Great coating! But thankful I have fried pickerel before.  Not sure how  thick their fish filets were but 2 -3 minutes per side... I do not like over cooked fish

I had mix all the flour ..bread crumbs  salt  pepper together ..then after dipping in that .back to a bit bread crumbs ..

Canadian Walleye? Not sure if this makes much of a difference but my Walleye were  fresh caught in Arkansas. Great recipe! I used regular breadcrumbs instead of Italian and they still turned out great!

Flavor was great, however I did use a cast iron pan and put it at the temp listed but because cast iron pans are great heat conductors the fish burned slightly. Next time I'll know better. Many thanks for this recipe.

This was super helpful, thank you! I've been looking for a skillet fish recipe where the breading didn't slide off and this was it! I changed pretty much every ingredient to suit my gluten-free and dairy-free needs, but I think the key was separating the flour and breadcrumbs. If anyone cares, I used 1 c. gluten free all purpose flour, 1/4 c almond milk, 2 c. cornmeal mixed with 1-2 tsp italian seasoning, and of course the eggs. It turned out great! Might be more flavorful with more salt or possibly some paprika?
