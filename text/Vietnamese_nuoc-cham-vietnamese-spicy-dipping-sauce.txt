Absolutely delicious! A versatile, ubber yummy sauce! So good I'd eat it off a dirty flip-flop on a dare.

This sauce was absolutely delicious. Store didn’t have the red pepper so I subbed Serranos. Very good.

I like the flavor and balance! I halved the recipe using 2T instead of 1/4 cup, 2 small garlic cloves. I only had a single small Serrano pepper on hand, sorry purists. I did NOT heat it - just shook it in covered container to dissolve the sugar. We used it to dip the mini egg rolls. We loved it, it’s now my go to quick sauce!

So good, just like the dipping sauce from restaurants.
