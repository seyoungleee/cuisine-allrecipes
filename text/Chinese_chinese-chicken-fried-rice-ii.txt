Excellent, easy recipe. I rinse the rice in cold water, so I don't have to wait. I also decreased the pepper because it's got a little too much zip.

Make sure your rice is COLD before you stir fry!!!!

This was soooooo good!  The only thing I did different was add an extra splash of soy sauce, and my husband wants me to add even more next time.

Very good! My husband really liked it and he does not like rice! Winner Winner!Also the rice has to be cold before stir frying it!

It says chicken fried rice,  The recipe has no chicken in it.  How do I cook the chicken>  Every time I cook chicken, it comes out super dry.

I also added a TSP of Sesame oil

I made this and it turned out delicious. The only substitutions I made were sesame oil where it called for vegetable oil, and a little less than 1 tsp of black pepper. I tried doubling the recipe and it was good but something was missing, not sure what?

We love this recipe!We used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.After dining at a Thai restaurant, we added a Thai twist. Fresh pineapple tidbits, golden raisins, a little garlic and red pepper flakes jazz it up. The next time we made it, we added shredded leftover duck breast!

Delicious! Took other reviewers recommendations to cook in sesame oil, add ginger, red pepper flakes, sliced water chestnuts, thawed peas, corn, green beans - what a treat!!

It was simple and easy to make.I also added onions, pees, carrots, and carrots.We loved it.Thank you

Good base recipe. A few changes and choices: I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, added just .5 tsp black pepper, but added .5 tsp garlic powder as well. For the chicken, I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs cooked in oil and seasoned with salt and pepper. It definitely can use a little extra something, so I would try adding some bell pepper and/or peas. I also might add an extra cup of rice, because the ratio of rice to other items seemed a little low.
