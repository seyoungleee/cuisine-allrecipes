I add a bit of milk to make them like a very thick pancake batter - my husband prefers them that way.

These are so good, I made them with homemade goat milk farmers cheese!

Used tvorog , not quark - a type of farmer's cheese.

We substituted sour cream for quark cheese and just added more flour to the mixture (to make it thicker.) Sooo good.

It has been a long while in my family. My kid loves them
