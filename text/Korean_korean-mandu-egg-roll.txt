I used egg roll wrappers as submitter mentioned in the footnotes. These were great and had a ton of flavor. I do think fresh bean sprouts would be better than can but the can worked too. The one thing I did think this recipe was lacking was cabbage. The meat/cabbage ratio seemed off and I would double the amount of cabbage next time.

it was so good and it tasted really good

Oh my God, YES! So good and surprisingly easy to make.

My family loved them.  I made them without changes and served them with orange sauce.

I made this recipe for my Korean-American professor and she loved it! I followed the recipe except for a couple of replacements. My professor doesn't eat pork so I used only beef and instead of bean sprouts I used finely chopped  green beans.  Also, I used egg roll wraps instead of wonton wraps and they turned out so delicious that everyone who tried them loved them. I will definitely make them again :)
