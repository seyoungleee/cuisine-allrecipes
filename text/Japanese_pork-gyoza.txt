This recipe almost makes it.  Add bacon Spam to your ground pork and you won't believe how good these will be.  Also, I use Savoy cabbage or Napa cabbage as it is sometimes called.  It is a little softer and more easily blended with the meat.  I also shred a bit of carrot for color.  If you use the Spam, you can leave out the egg.  I never use egg.  The spam holds it all together well.

Very good after I took out the egg, it has no use in the filling!

I have also added reconstituted dry  shitake mushrooms that have been simmered in a dashi, soy sauce and mirin mixture, drained of excess moisture, sqeezed out, minced and added to the gyoza filling. Also add some grated fresh ginger. Have something simmering on the side with a little zing as a dipping sauce. Oh, and savoy or nappa cabbage work best, slivered and chopped.

My husband and I love this recipe. And if you are not a fan of pork, ground beef also works amazingly well!

These are delicious and I will be making them again. The only change I made was I added a small squeeze of honey to the dipping sauce.

Yummy. I'll make these again.
