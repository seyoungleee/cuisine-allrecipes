Gave them a four star because the taste is awesome.  However, not sure if I did something wrong but, after my dough cooled it was still very very sticky.  Couldn’t work with it like in the video.  Did not have anymore chicken broth so I added enough flour to make it workable.  When I tried to make the bowls with the dough, that was a disaster as well...so, I mixed the dough and chicken together, used an ice cream scoop to make the balls and finished with egg and breadcrumbs.
Air fried them and they were Delicious.  Just like Banquet used to make in the 70’s.  Added cream of chicken soup with half a can of milk as gravy.

The recipe is incorrect in that it calls for 1 cup of all purpose flour, when it should be 2.  It's correct in the video, but I didn't figure that out until I had dumped two attempts before adding the second cup for the third...  The dough will dry out very quickly so keep it covered with a damp towel for the duration once you've cooled it enough to knead.  The chicken was fairly bland and I plan to add something to it to kick it up next time.

Need 2 cups flour for the pastry.
