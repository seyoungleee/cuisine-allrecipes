Great recipe. Thank you. Some people are so rude! It's called this not that. I added this this and that etc... If people are going to add so much to a recipe, then you are not following the recipe, so how can you rate it one way or another? If you insist on changing so much on a recipe, write your own and don't say you followed somone's recipe (but made your own additions) and then leave them 4 stars after you completely changed the recipe.

it was so-so. Too sweet.

I made this lowcarb by using Splenda instead of the sugar and it was really good.

Simple, tasty, quick.  I threw in some diced red onion and only had ground ginger.  I can imagine it would be even better with fresh!

As simple as it gets and tasty! You can adjust the sugar and salt to your taste.

Very delicious ðŸ˜‹ whole family loved it ! Kids asked for more... ... Thank you

This is so easy and tasty.  I sometimes add thinly sliced onion, but otherwise follow the recipe as written  We have it almost every week.

simple and easy - I did reduce sugar for health reasons.

Everyone always asks me to bring this when we get together. Itâ€™s so refreshing and delicious. The only thing I donâ€™t do is halve and scoop out seeds I just slice the cucumber very thin.

Super easy, light, fresh!!!

Very tasty and a good use of my abundance of cucumbers.
