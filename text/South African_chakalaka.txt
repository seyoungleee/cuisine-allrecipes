6.19.21 I’ve never before had Chakalaka and didn’t really know how to serve it, so I Google’d it.  Every recipe that I saw had beans in it, so that is one addition I made, and would do again.  I think this is a recipe where you have to season to taste, so I did adjust the seasonings.  Served with basmati rice and a cilantro-lime cucumber salad for a nice meal.
