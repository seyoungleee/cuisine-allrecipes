I made this according to the recipe.   It turned out delicious.   I maybe let it marinate a little too long (24 hours), so the flavors were strong.   Served it with a peanut sauce, coconut rice, and cucumber salad.   Highly recommended.

I like to use this marinade to make ribs! Try it with some peanut sauce on top. Delicious!

Definitely make the peanut sauce to go with it.

This was really good and flavorful...but I combined with my favorite spicy Thai peanut sauce from this website and the two together were almost too spicy.  I could not find the ancho chills powder...and so substituted half aleppo Chilli powder and regular chili powder.  This might have accounted for more of the heat.  But I will definitely find the ancho and try this one again.

My dad loved it! My mom was Asian, too!

Chef John does it again! This was amazing!

Excellent .. I made it and got it right first time. Deliver as promised

Pretty good I liked it.  Thereâ€™s probably one spice in there I might not be to crazy about or maybe needed some lemon.  Overall was good.

Brought my husband to tears...such a great recipe! I did add the coconut milk to the marinade since I knew I would have it left from the peanut dipping sauce recipe.I have already sent the recipe to my daughter and sister. Wonderful!!!

We made these skewers, opting to forego the peanut sauce and they were... AMAZING! Wouldn't change a thing on the recipe. We cooked them in the broiler given the show outside, but they were tender and very flavorful. We love Chef John at our house, so this was a natural fit. As the kids are fond of saying... "and as always, ENJOY!"
