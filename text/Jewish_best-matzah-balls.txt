I have tried probably ten recipes for matzoh balls.  This one is the BEST!!

Wonderful recipe. I subbed two tablespoons of schmaltz for two  tablespoons of  the olive oil. Very fluffy and flavorful.

YOU must loosley form your matzah balls. Mine came out way too firm and I did not understand why. So, I looked up on a different site that you can not compact you matzah balls too much or they will be too firm. That had a negative impact on the flavor and fluffiness.

Delicious tender matzo balls. I made them exactly as ''tis recipe states. My family loves them!

I followed the recipe to a "T" and the result was perfectly moist and tender matzoh balls. Previous attempts using other recipes were edible, but not good. Another user said these would fall apart if left in the soup. Mine held together for three days just fine. This is now my "go to" recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but I wanted to say this is very forgiving. I used a food processor to grind the last half of a box of matzo at the end of Passover and halved the recipe, and the balls came out great!

Stay together great! Taste great

This is my favorite matzah ball receipe.

Easy and fast to make, stayed together beautifully.  Tasted great.
