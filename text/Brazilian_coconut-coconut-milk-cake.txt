Just noticed that quite a few people have tried my recipe and was so excited that most of you enjoy it! =) I did notice that those who complained about it having too much baking soda - respectfully - read the directions. =) It's actually supposed to be Baking POWDER. I can imagine Baking Soda would be really gross! lol =)

Made this for a birthday - a dozen people liked it.  Used sweetened coconut flakes therefore reduce to 1-1/2 c white sugar. and added vanilla at step 2 (1-2 tsp).  Delicious and moist, just yummy! served with lightly sweetened fresh whipped cream and some blackberries.

I made this cake and I loved it but the picture shows a Bundt cake and the instructions read to put it in a 19 x 13. Is the timing different with a Bundt pan?

Super moist ðŸ˜‹ will cook more often :)I made chocolate cover â€” guests loved the cake.

Deliciousâ€¦. I cut the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet, added 1/4 tsp coconut extract. I think it would be delicious as the base for a strawberry trifle and canâ€™t wait to try it!

Amazing cake. I used sweet coconut flakes in the cake, 1 tspn vanilla extract and added 1/2 c flour. When I say tasty, moist but not overly dense and did a struessel with toasted coconut  OMG. THANK YOU!

I love this recipe. I always cut the sugar in half, and use whipped cream rather than any icing, topped with toasted coconut. It's always a hit at the potlucks! It's also my default Easter cake with the addition of pastel colored jelly beans!

Delicious, though a little too dense for my taste - but I had only used 1 Tbsp. baking powder. Will try again with 2 Tbsp.

A half recipe fit perfectly in my instapot Bundt pan. I added some orange peel to the cake and frosting only because I had some available, otherwise it would be delicious without any.

Perfect, moist, sensational springtime cake
