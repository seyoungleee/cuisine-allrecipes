As a southerner, I consider myself some thing of a biscuit connoisseur! This is a wonderful recipe. I did not have buttermilk so I made sour milk using whole milk and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. That worked wonderfully and these biscuits were divine! The whole family loved them and we will definitely make them again. Highly recommend!

Love it Awsome and easy

Perfect biscuit recipe. Family loved it!

I have made these multiple times and they are requested often!  My husband makes the gravy and make the biscuits. Super easy!

These were delightful! Made then at the cottage and they were perfect. I didnâ€™t have buttermilk, so I used milk with vinegar and a few tablespoons of plain yogurt whisked in. I will make these again
