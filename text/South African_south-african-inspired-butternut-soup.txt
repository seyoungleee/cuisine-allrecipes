5.16.21  I must say when I started with a pot FULL of chopped onion, I had my doubts.  I followed this recipe to the letter and cooked for 1-1/2 hours.  When I used the immersion blender, it was w-a-a-a-y too thick.  I did add considerably more chicken broth to reach my desired consistency, and I think that diluted the squash flavor just a bit.  I did use a very large jalapeño, but its flavor was lost in the soup, so not sure I’d even bother adding that again.  Although I’ll admit that Curried Butternut Squash and Pear Soup on this site still is my favorite, this one’s hitting a close second.  In the future, I think I’ll emulsify the soup as soon as the squash is cooked trying to retain the full butternut squash flavor.  This one’s a keeper, and I definitely would make again!
