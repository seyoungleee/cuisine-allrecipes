Great flavor! Family favorite!

Loved the recipe. I added 2 teaspoonfuls of ketchup to give it the reddish hie I am used to in the restaurant.i used dried chilie flakes

12.11.20  Enjoyed this spicy sauce on some vegetable spring rolls.  So very easy to make, and it had the perfect level of spiciness for us.  I used a sugar substitute to try to reduce the carbs, and it worked very well.  I  had some concerns about too much sugar and salt, but it all blended together perfectly.  I’m glad I have some left because we’ll have this with some coconut shrimp next week.

I didn’t have bird’s eye chilli, so I substituted with chili powder and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  It’s absolutely delicious.  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is the "real deal"! And so simple! I spent several years in Thailand and this is THE recipe for this sauce. I have a sensitive palate so I used Aleppo pepper flakes (for the flavor but less heat) instead of the bird's eye chili and it was perfect! I will always have this in my fridge now!

This recipe is a keeper!
I used chili paste instead of a chili pepper. Easy to make.

Great dip sometimes I add some coriander and chopped cucumber, it’s my go to Thai dipping sauce.

Simplest and best dipping sauce ever! Just perfect!

Yum. Just like our Thai restaurant

Great flavor! Family favorite!
