So, this is one of my favorite Korean dishes. You can bet I'm ordering this EVERY TIME I go out to eat at a Korean restaurant. It's also my favorite dish to introduce to newbies to this type of Asian cuisine. Of note:  the recipe mentions "fish cakes" but not "rice cakes." Both are a must for this dish. I didn't have fish cakes on hand so could not use them this time (quarantine) but I always have rice cakes either in the fridge or the freezer. Loved the sweet sauce, although I reduced the sugar to 1.5 T since this recipe called for corn syrup (which I actually loved this addition). I also added minced garlic to the sauce. And I was very varied in my Korean fish stock. The ingredients used...water and anchovies are, of course, great, but I added konbu, green onion, onion, dried mushrooms, ginger to the stock, then strained all that out to make the broth clear. Super flavorful this way. Overall, the sauce is what made the dish for me, and I appreciate the author taking the time to capture the recipe!
