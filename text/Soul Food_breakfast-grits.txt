My wife had never tried grits, so I made these for her.  I used half water, half milk and stirred in crumbled bacon bits at the end.  Not only were they fantastic that day, they were even better the next day when I formed the leftovers in to patties and browned them in some melted butter.  Not the healthiest thing in the world by any means, but  tasty!

Cheese grits are OK, but they are better without. I prefer quick grits that cook in 5 minutes. 4 cups water to 1 cup grits.  In either case, best recipe is on the box. For variety, the yellow corn grits/polenta is outstanding.

It is very very good best grits I've had on a long time.

Easy to cook i halved this recipe cause it was for my southern husband, he loved it and loved cheesy grits

Like this recipe, it makes more than I can eat in one sitting so I put some in the fridge for the next morning and they taste pretty good reheated

I used half an avocado for the fat, eliminating the butter and cheese, and salt to taste.  It was delicious!

I use milk instead of water. I also use cayenne pepper sometimes and black pepper other times. I pinch of salt and lots of cheese:)

Left it the way it was

I made this as a breakfast side. I didn't add salt and I used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of water. It was delicious!!!

just like my mom made when I was a kid
