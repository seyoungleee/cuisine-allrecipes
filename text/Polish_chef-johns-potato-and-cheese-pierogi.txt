This turned out excellent for our Christmas Eve dinner!Made the dough ahead (actually 48 hours before I got to it), and used cheddar with cream cheese. Cooked it in batches via air fryer, boiled, and pan fried. My husband said boiled with butter was the winner!

Delicious!  We couldn't find farmers cheese so used queso fresco (I'm told they are the same thing).

Amazing and simple recipe! I did a little spin on it because I had these ingredients on hand already and my hubby loves these flavors. I made my pierogis with sweet potato, feta, 4oz. Of sharp cheese, cream cheese, thyme, rosemary, Cayenne pepper, paprika, seasoned to taste. They taste amazing! Thank you for such a great base recipe ðŸ¤—

Great recipe! Surprisingly easy to make - time consuming but worth it. Brings me back to my childhood in Pittsburgh where I had these all the time.
