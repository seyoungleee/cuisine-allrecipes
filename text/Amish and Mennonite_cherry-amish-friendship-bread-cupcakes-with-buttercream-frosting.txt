Yum!!

I didn't care for it, but then I'm not a big fan of cherry flavored food. Will not repeat.

I only made the frosting part of this recipe because i already had a cake i was making but had no frosting and i found this and this frosting is so delicious and creamy smooth, we really like this frosting, Also I used butter flavor crisco, has a nice buttery taste to it Thank you.

Yum!!
