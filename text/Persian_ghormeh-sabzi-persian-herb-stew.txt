its so delicious.

Didn’t have the limes and it was still delicious.

Excellent flavor profile. Highly suggest to pair this with Lemon Basmati Rice: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/215094/lemon-basmati-rice/The rice and this dish were a hit with the family!

Thank you, thank you, thank you. I've been trying to make this dish correctly for a couple months. I know this dish and how it's supposed to taste. I'd followed other recipes, but I could never get it right. On this, my 5th try, I got it right. Now I can make it at home instead of buying it from a restaurant.

I made this recipe on recommendation from a friend; and it's absolutely delicious! I've never made anything with dried limes before, and I have to say: I'm hooked! I made this using a venison roast in place of beef, and left out the fresh chives because the store had none. Otherwise, I made it as written; and wouldn't change a thing! I served it over saffron basmati rice. So unbelievably good--that we ate it before I could get a picture! Thank you for the recipe! I will be making this again!

Very much like our family recipes I have made 44 years since marrying a Persian. I sub leeks for some onion and scallions. Never throw out the limoo emani! We fight over it like tahig. Those persian lemon/limes become soft and delicious after being in the stew an hour.

Delicious

I had to make it from scratch because I didn’t have any dry ingredients in the house. So much flavor and so easy to make.

I Absolutely Love this recipe. 
My father is Persian and cooks this all the time and it is one of my all time favorites soups. 
Thankyou so much for this recipe. 
Now , I can continue to make it myself .

Very good different type of stew, I will make it again
