I personally do like a good beef stroganoff. This recipe was not it for me. It tasted good, but was really thick. It was not a hit in my house and I will not be making this again. Also in the ingredients it calls for cream of chicken soup and in the directions says cream of mushroom. I used the cream of chicken.

This was absolutely wonderful.  Don't skip the pounding of seasoning step- it really makes the flavor of the beef stand out.  I added a little sauvignon blanc in the gravy along with some additional salt and pepper.  While fresh would have been best, I only had dried parsley so sprinkled that on top.  I would recommend slicing the mushrooms as they soak up the sauce. So so so good!
