This was very good and texture came out perfect.  I followed the recipe as written except reduced the sugar to about 1/2 cup because I was worried it was going to be too sweet with the macapuno strings.  Also lined the pan for easy clean up.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I love this. Sweet and chewy.  Great gluten free treat

Perfect snack or dessert, as mentioned.  I ate chewy rice flour and coconut confections as a child and this recipe fits the bill.Husband also developed a gluten sensitivity to this treat is a welcome addition to what he can enjoy.Instead of baking in a large pan, I halved the recipe and baked in three smaller square pans.  Baked in half the time and enjoyed them sooner!

Decent recipe but disappointed after baking on a sheet pan as directed, as the bibingka turned out much too thin. Tried the recipe again in a 13 x 9 pan and it yielded a much better (and albeit more traditional) result.

The first time I made this,  I only had one jar of macapuno.  It was good, but it came a tad dry.  For this 2nd attempt, I had 2 jars of macapuno.  It turned our perfect, but is a tad too sweet for my liking.  I will likely reduce the brown sugar by 1/2 next time.
