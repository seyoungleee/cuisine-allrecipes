Excellent recipe , as suggested adding cardomn is traditional as is using almond instead of vanillia. All norwegian cookie recipes are based on butter sugar almond and eggs.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe. The krumkaker came out too sweet and chewy.

I double the recipe and add 1tsp. ground cardamon, no butter flavor added. We love it. Making again today. 3rd week in a row.

I used 1 t. of vanilla instead of 1/2 t.
Melted the butter.

Now it tastes like the family recipe.

I added 1/2 tsp baking powder because I saw it on another recipe but I don’t think it was needed. I didn’t have butter extract and I used 1% canned milk. This was my first attempt making these and I think they turned out well. I’m sure I will make them again with the baking power next time.

When I used my electric iron they all turned soggy., I did them exactly as the recipe says

I added about 2 tsp cardamom, yum!!!

Good recipe. We opted for cardamom instead of butter extract. I added an extra 2Tbsp flour, so they stayed together better during baking. This might be my measuring, or maybe the weather. We baked them for 52 seconds in my 2- krumkake electric cooker.

I made this recipe exactly as printed.  It was my first time ever making Krumkake.  The flavor was excellent. I did not use Almond extract or Cardamon. In all of my Norwegian cooking I have found very few recipes that call for either.  Cardamon is a bit more prevalent in Finnish cooking.  I didn’t have the cone firm so I rolled the cookie around a sharpie!  Taste the same either way!  Time to make another batch!!!  Yummy!

Wow. These were DELICIOUS! My hubby and the kids devoured them. I do not have a Krumkake iron so I used my pizelle iron. I think they would be thinner if I had a Krumkake iron. But in the end it worked well. Mt pizelle iron is electric and it to 1 min 10 sec to bake them.

memories of me and my Norwegian grandma making g these in her kitchen when I was very small and now I have inherited her iron .
