This is exactly how we make our smelts every Christmas Eve and they are delicious. The simple flour coating really allows the flavor of the smelts to shine~YUM!

This recipe is a quick and easy attempt at satisfying a smelt dinner desire.

I prepared 1lb of smelts. Instead of salt, I added lemon pepper which has a small amount of salt in it. I also added garlic powder and crushed red pepper. I fried them about 4 minutes each side. I don't think the company dressed them as well as they could have. There were large bones that would not get as crispy as I would have liked them.
I will try the recipe again once I find smelts from a different source.

Totally loved this super duper easy recipe. 3 ingredients and 2 cooking steps. Right up my alley! And it was quite good. I actually received a compliment from my husband on these Fried Smelts. I have made this twice as the batter was a lot and I did not use the entire package of smelts on my first try. Recommend this for any and everyone. A more experienced cook would be able to add spices and flavouring successfully.

This lacked flavor and interest.

I added a couple of spices (Cumin and Garlic) along with salt and pepper to give it some flavor.  Just dredging it in flower without an egg-wash first made for a more delicate crust..I liked that.

I used gluten free flour (without any gums).  Worked just fine.

no changes made it like this for years. we serve w/lemon wedges.

Primo, just like the old days at Grammie Browns! Cut back to 1 tbl salt, added 1 tsp black pepper.

Very simple and tasty!
