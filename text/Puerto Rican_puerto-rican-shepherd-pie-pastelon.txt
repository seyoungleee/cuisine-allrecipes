I have made this with just the meat cooked with sofrito and sazon, and the sweet plantains fried and layered like it says. Even simply made, this is absolutely delicious!

This recipe was ok. Totally edible but not as authentic as I'd prefer. My mom has been making this for years. Although her recipes differs. Personally, the secret is in the "sofrito". My mother usually makes sofrito in large batches and freezes it in ice cube trays. Once they're frozen, she pops them into large ziplocs. This way, you can use as little or as much as you'd like without fear of spoiling the batch. The plantains should be as ripe as possible & cut lengthwise for best results. My husbands Italian family LOVES Pastelon!

Very good. We used frozen mixed vegetables instead .

It was delicious!! I made it without the green beans. Yum!!

Will make with riper plantin, and omit green beans

excellent recipe.

Tasted very good.  But, it didn't mention how big the baking dish should be.  I must have used a larger one than recipe called for. So, next time I will used smaller dish or  more plantains and more eggs. We didn't use any oil.  We fried the plantains with Pam.  Now, my mother-in-law says, she sprays the casserole dish with Pam and adds the eggs first.  Then Plantain and so forth.  Also, the plantains should be as ripe as possible & cut lengthwise, And She adds a layer of (can) corn.  I will definitely make this again.

It's the best dish I ever ate. My new favorite food. Love it.

It should be noted that the plantains should be VERY ripe, the softer the better.  The next time I'll probably use chorizo instead of ground beef, and I used frozen green beans (sauteed in a little olive oil and fresh garlic) instead of canned.

Not very good.

This was great!! Just like mom usto make
