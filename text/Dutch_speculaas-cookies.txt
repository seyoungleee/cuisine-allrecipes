These turned out great, but I replaced all the spices with Speculaas spice from the market in Delft. Next time I will use a full tablespoon of it.

This was fun, delicious and simple. Treated myself to some beautiful springerle molds, but my husband was craving speculaas. These not only look beautiful but taste great. We read the Legend of the Christmas Cookie by Dandi Daley Mackall with the kids and this is an awesome tie-in and activity. Like other reviewers, I used speculaas spice (King Arthurâ€™s) in lieu of other spices.

I halved it .  It was EXCELLENT.  I used 1 T of speculaas spice which I made some time ago from a recipe long lost.  I am going to try this again with some veg shortening instead of or partially instead of reg butter just to see how it turns out.  I never realized that one could simply flour a pan!  Thanks for the recipe.  Husband and I both loved it.
