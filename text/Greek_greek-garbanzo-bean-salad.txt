I took this to work, as one co-worker is vegetarian.  Everyone raved about the salad. 

Three minor adjustments:  I added a whole (6oz) carton of herb feta cheese, used a small can of olives and added 1/2 chopped green pepper.

OK but doesn't have the complexity of flavor that I was hoping for.

Delicious as is!  One of my all time favorites ðŸ˜‹

Perfect as it is.

I made it as written, but we just didn't care for the taste.  I do better when exact measurements are given and would have preferred if the recipe for the Italian dressing was included.  The recipe as written just didn't work for me.

I added a lemon vinegrette, tsp of capers, yellow and green pepper sun dried tomato.

Very good!

Really good! I didn't measure anything and I used Greek dressing because that's what I had. Perfect summer side salad that has some high quality proteins (I used garbanzo and white beans).

Great recipe but I add capers as well and I agree your own unsweet vinegar or lemon based salad dressing will do. A real plus is how well it keeps.

We love this recipe.  Itâ€™s quick and easy to put together.  I did make an olive oil/lemon dressing for it instead of Italian as called for. Delicious!
