These are great, I didn’t change a thing.

What's perfect as is!

I used pork spare ribs instead and cooked the entire 5# rack. At the end I had cut half the rack into singles and placed the onions, garlic and oregano on top of each and turned up the heat to 425⁰ F for 10 additional minutes to brown slightly. I loved the flavors that was incorporated, especially the lemon. If your looking for something exciting and different...THIS is it! Enjoy!!

Made exactly as written... didn't change a thing.  ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!  Family raved and no leftovers. Thanks so much for a great recipe... yamas!!!

Fabulous!!!!  Thank you for the recipe. 
I was not able to marinate for 4 hours ,  only 2 1/2 maybe 3 hours. Cooked at 400 for 15 minutes, covered with foil and upped the temp to 425 for 30 minutes, uncovered  for an additional 15 minutes . The ribs were tender and tasty. I look forward to making them again , marinating for longer  and baking pe the r eclipse. A definite keeper.

Tried many times without a recipe ... honey and onion made the difference AWESOME!

These are great, I didn’t change a thing.

Absolutely will make them again and again.
