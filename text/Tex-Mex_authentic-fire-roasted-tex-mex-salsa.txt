This is my all-time favorite salsa and like you, I can drink it.  Actually, crave it.  However, the quality of the batch from Los Cucos restaurants varies, and making it at home is the best.I go to Walmart and buy 20 tomatoes, 1 big onion, 4 jalapenos and limes, cilantro and make one big batch.It freezes very well!  Oh, and I add a little liquid smoke or sometimes grill all veggies on the grill.  Thank you!

Wow!! Just like in the restaurant! Don't know if I'll ever make salsa a different way.

Fantastic and simple recipe and is just like the warm salsa served at many great Tex-mex restaurants. I recommend it warm but itâ€™s great cold too. I use half an onion, 6 Roma tomatoes and about 4 jalepenos de-seeded and rinsed to make the mild to medium heat. 8 or more Jalepenos with seeds and all for the fiery stuff. Truly takes about 20 minutes to make.

Excellent.   Very similar to Los Cucos which I agree is the best salsa there is.

This recipe was fantastic! I love Los Cucos salsa and this is definitely similar in taste. I have tried many salsa recipes out there and this is now my go to!
