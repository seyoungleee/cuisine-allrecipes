9/20/21: I had a banana and some frozen pumpkin I wanted to use up, so this recipe seemed like a good option. It was definitely unusual, and it was ok, but neither of us liked it enough to make it again.  9/21/21 update: I increased my rating from 3 stars to 4 because the next day the cold leftover soup is so much better than the just-made hot soup. Make it the day before and eat it chilled!

Excellent soup!  I modified it slightly because I did not have some of the ingredients on hand:  So I omitted the banana and brown sugar and increased the carrots to make up for no banana.
