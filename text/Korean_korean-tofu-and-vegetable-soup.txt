Think I did a pretty good job itâ€™s so delicious

I spent a year in Korea teaching English and doenjang jjigae was one of my favourite meals. It's so easy to make, as long as you can find the soybean paste. This recipe doesn't taste quite the same as what I had in restaurants in Korea, but it's still satisfying.
