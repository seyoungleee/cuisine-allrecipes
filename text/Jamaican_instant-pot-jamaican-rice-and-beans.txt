We really enjoyed this and I will definitely make it again. I had a problem with the rice becoming soggy and canâ€™t figure out why. I will try a different rice next time but even mushy, it was delicious. I used one cup of dried beans, which I soaked overnight instead of canned. Easy one pot dinner. Thank you!
