I love it.  I added a review just below here, not adding a photo. So I will try here.

I like the flavor and can't wait to add raisins at some point. I will be skipping the blender part because my blender will not blend this stuff to a smooth mixture. Not mad about it though.

I really like the porridge, especially the texture, but I found it too sweet for my taste.  I will go with a little less sugar next time I make it. Otherwise, yummy!
