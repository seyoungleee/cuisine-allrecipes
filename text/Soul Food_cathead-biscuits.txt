Simple, simple simple.  just a few ingredients and you can't screw it up.  The only thing is to watch the milk.  like other reviewers, decrease about a 1/4 cup.  I also useregular flour and add 4 level teaspoons of baking powder to make up for the self rising flour.   For the butter milk i used 2 teaspoons of vinegar with 2 cups regular milk. (Thanks for a great week night biscuit recipe.

Maybe it was me but these had no taste at all. They were super doughy in the middle but I've read that it could be bc I used too much buttermilk

Easy recipe. These are a dense, delicious biscuit. Perfect for soup or lapping up sauce or gravy.

Just like my grandmaws! Very tasty

The Best, as a child growing up my Aunt Mary would make these! We would put fried Venison back strap or Blackberry Jelly or Cane Syrup mixed with Peanut Butter  between the halves. Then! go out on the porch and eat tinny bits to make it last longer.

It was fantastic

I added an 1/8 tsp of salt. Excellent!

I'm getting ready to make this. I know its a good recipe because you stated, white Lilly flour. To be clear here, this flour is made from a Southern wheat. A soft wheat. That's the key. That's what makes it lighter and fluffier.

Oh MY!!! These are SO GOOD!!! 

Since I didn’t have self rising flour I added 4 tsp of baking powder at the suggestion of another persons review.  Also used 1-1/2 cups buttermilk.   Just perfect!!!

Great recipe!!  Turn out perfect every time. I add melted butter on top then bake.  Thanks 4 sharing.

These were absolutely amazing. I didn’t have buttermilk, but I substituted with the ol’ 1c milk + 1tbsp vinegar trick and they worked out wonderfully.
