I have been making cod fish cakes for years. This recipe is almost identical to my mothers recipe.  My family loves them.  I also use the same recipe to make salmon cakes.  Delicious!!!!

Very messy.  Chilled in the fridge and added flour to try and improve texture.  No luck super sticky and messy

thanks

BEST!

It was quick and easy to make.

Exactly my moms recipe I grew up with in MA. We put tomatoe soup on top try it it is good.

To save calories I dusted the cakes with bread crumbs and baked at 500 degrees for 10 minutes on the upper rack. Came out hot, crunchy on the outside, flaky on the inside. Great simple delicious recipe!

This is my favourite recipe for cod cakes.. they are awesome..

Mother’s Day wife loved it

Very tasty. I skipped the “roll in flour” step though. I refrigerated the formed cakes for an hour before frying, and they held together just fine.  Used the traditional Portugese 2-spoon-forming technique, rather than golfball method. Had plenty left over uncooked that I froze for another day.   I did grate the onion as another suggested, draining the juice before adding to the mix.

Needs more spice, so we added cilantro, pepper and garlic. AOK
