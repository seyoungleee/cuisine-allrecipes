So tasty!  The flavor in this is truly exceptional, I'd definitely make sure to include the peanut sauce for the depth of flavor.  I accidentally added a tablespoon of roasted chili dded a tablespoon of roasted chili paste (the jar looked identical to the red curry paste in my fridge) in addition to the other ingredients and I'm glad I did, if you're a fan of heat I'd recommend doing the same (and maybe even adding more!).  The sauce was a little on the thin side and personally I like it a little thicker so I added a small amount of corn starch slurry at the end.  All in all this recipe is fabulous as written and an absolute keeper!

This  recipe is fantastic, I increased the spices as we like it spicy and used peanut butter instead of peanut sauce but otherwise kept everything the same, Fantastic!! THANK YOU!
