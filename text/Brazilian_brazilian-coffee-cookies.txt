I've been making these cookies for years.  They work best with the flavoured powdered instant coffees.  Don't cook them quite so long for a really yummy chewy cookie.

This was just okay for me.  I think what really turned me off was the granules of instant coffee that I'd crunch into while I was eating the cookie.  If I ever make this again, I'll try a powder or I'll use fresh-brewed coffee.

My family loved it! I will definitely make this again.

These cookies are a delight, but maybe cook them a for a little less time.

Like others say, use more coffee. Made these a dozen times. Cool for 8 minutes for softer, 12 for crunchy. Easy recipe

Added an extra table of coffee.  Dough was dry and crumbly, like pie crust before adding water.  Added a couple more tables of milk.  May be because of low moisture in the flour in our dry climate.  Not quite what mom and I used to make 50+ years ago, but very good.  I think her recipe had molasses in it. Someday I'll find that recipe box!

Double the coffee if you want them to have a coffee flavor and use all brown sugar instead white for softer cookies that don't turn into hockey pucks in one day. When I did that everyone loved them

great cookies i am going to be making these again

These are a long-time favorite and always get tons of compliments!

The recipe is perfect and makes delicious coffee cookies! Thank you!

These were good, but needs a bit more instant coffee. I added about 1/3 C powdered coffee creamer and reduced the sugar a bit. I rolled them in small balls, rolled them in sugar and I didn't flatten them.  I flattened one in my trial bake and liked the round one better. I  was able to put about 30 on my cookie sheet.  I baked them about 11  min. on an air bake cookie sheet.  These were slightly dryer than I like, but where I live people like a more crunchy cookie. If I make these for myself I would reduce the time.
