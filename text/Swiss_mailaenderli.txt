Easy to make & very tasty - thank you for this recipe!

they were a bit dry and the dough was hard to scoop out of the bowl after i chilled it.But overall they were great!

I am fond of these cookies, they always come out well..especially in terms of flavour , texture and shape. Each ingredient is in perfect ratio.

Made these for my sons Ancestor project! Found out we are Swiss! Instantly fell in love with these and they will from now on be included in our holiday dinners!

Very good! Had a nice lemon twist to otherwise fairly bland sugar cookies. Loved the unique taste! Next time I would've used a little more sugar.. just to make it less bland. But they were really good.Made them for my French class!

This recipe made light tasting cookies, great for tea, but I wouldn't know since they don't last that long! Added a glaze of lemon juice, vanilla, and powdered sugar.

I was very satified with the taste of this cookie.  I think it could have used more flavor though.  But other than that I would reccomend this.

Loved these!!!  I made these with my Girl Scout Troop for Thinking Day!   They were hard to roll out at first. I made a double batch and made most of these up with the girls helping.  We ran out of time and I had to finish the next day with my Daughter.  It was so much easier after being in the Fridge overnight - Will add this recipe to my Holiday collection -already decided to use this as Teacher gifts Christmas 2011!!
