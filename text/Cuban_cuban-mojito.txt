This is a true Mojito! A must have recipe-I spend most of my summers in and around the Carribean, this drink always takes me back there!

This drink is just o.k.  I have made this for several different gatherings, adding more sugar each time, and I still hear from guests that it needs to be sweeter.

Almost perfect! I learned in Habana to use powdered sugar (heaping tablespoon each glass) & lots more mint!! Good w/ Lime Perrier instead of Club Soda. Very refreshing!!

Very simple and very refreshing to have during these hot afternoons.

Such a easy recipe and great use of my mint plant this summer. For my seltzer I had a lime flavored seltzer. I also bought a lime flavored light rum.

Classic!!

Nice smooth. Not too sweet

authentic variations -  (ht to Key West Legal Rum Distillery)

1/ two tsp (or 3, or 4) of turbinado / demerara sugar - imparts a molasses hint
2/ KEY LIMES, eg key lime juice - imparts a more intense lime experience - see Kermit's or other
3/ mint with their stems - stems have more mint oil than just leaves

avoid the slice of lime - the white pulp is extra bitter

muddle 20 times - no more, no less

use a long thin spoon, not a straw - the Mojito experience is to continue to work/remix the ingredients up & down as you savor it

I've previously made mojitos using a sugar syrup rather than sugar. This seems to be the only difference. Other than at Cuban restaurants, I have not had a Mojito outside of Cuba that I really liked... till this one. Thanks.

Needed more sweetness for me.
