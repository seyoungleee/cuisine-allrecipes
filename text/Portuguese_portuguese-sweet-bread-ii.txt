This was a really good and simple recipe to use in the bread machine. I think it would benefit from a little more flavouring though, more lemon juice or extract.  When this bread is typically made (by hand) by the Portuguese they start out by heating up the milk with some lemon rind in a pot on the stove, giving it that added flavour.  Rose nicely though, almost worried it would rise right out of the machine!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This may be a sweet bread made by someone who is Portuguese but it is not the yellow egg bread which is what real Portuguese Sweet Bread is and has always been about; whether bought at the festivals or what my Grandma used to make.

Easy and tasty recipe

Delicious and easy. I don't have a bread machine so used the old fashioned method and it worked beautifully. I also used whole wheat flour. Thanks for the recipe!

I love it! Even using an off brand, self-rise flour, (and oh yes, I can tell the difference when it comes to breads) it turned out wonderfully. Even my picky 5 year old ate two slices by itself. Thank you so very much for sharing.

I've tried this a couple of times.  I lave the bread but it rises like crazy and then collapses in the middle.  Is it me?  My cheapo bread machine?  Or is there a real reason?  Please help.  I'm new to this and my wife is laughing at me.

I tried this recipe today.  It came out perfect.  It tastes wonderful.  Definitely doing this one agajn.

Our exchange student from Brazil very much appreciated this bread.  Said it matched her mothers.  What a complimant !  :)

I disliked the lemon taste.  Was dissapointing..

The bread turns out to be really creamy and yummy.  During the first kneading cycle, the dough appeared to be a little wet, so I added about another tablespoon of flour during the second kneading cycle.  The bread is not very sweet, you can for sure add another 1/4 cup of sugar to make it sweeter.
