Using this recipe with some minor modifications allowed me to prepare better fried okra than my mom!  Instead of plain cornmeal I used a pre-mixed  cornmeal, four, salt mixture.  I also added a little bit of buttermilk to the egg mixture.  I'm sure the use of flour along with the cornmeal is the secret to keeping the batter on during cooking.  Another secret is to make sure your oil is good and hot before adding the okra.

Good ... but, people, keep in mind: This is fried okra, NOT batter-dipped okra. Some of the breading WILL fall off when you are cooking it ... that is part of the dish, however, the "crunchies" ... handle gently when frying, and it will come out yummy ... thanks for the recipe!
