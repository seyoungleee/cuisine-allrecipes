Awesome seafood dish! I added a teaspoon of red curry to turn the heat up a little. Wonderful dish.

I used Thai chili peppers instead of jalepenos and used a good amount of cayenne. I also fried my fish with blackened seasoning with a lil bit of oil. So good. Probably one of my favorite meals. Thank you Chef John.

Chef John's, thank you for a very fast and easy Moqueca recipe, the coconut milk gives the sauce a very silky texture. I used Catfish nuggets, and the final product was fantastic.

Made it with cod & a handful of shrimp, delicious!

This Recipe is amazing! I substituted the Sea Bass for Swai because that's all I had. Also, someone else said they added Red Curry paste to spice it up and I tried that. I would definitely recommend!

Just found Chef John !This is quite fabulous and so quickA keeper

Chef John is one of my favorite chefs that I follow.  I have made this twice now. Once I followed the recipe and the other time, I doubled the recipe and added shrimp and cod.  This is a fantastic recipe and a family favorite. Cheers!

It is quick and easy to make and the result is delicious.

Wonderful dish.  Flavor galore and I especially liked the fullness of the sauce.  This is a repeat dish.  Next time I will use full fat coconut milk, I had to use a combo of half and half and milk this time and I loved it.

Very tasty dish, will definitely make it  again. I used coriander fresh leaves instead of  cilantro leaves and fresh cayenne chilli instead of jalapenos.
