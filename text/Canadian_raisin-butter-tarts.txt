This recipe is delicious, but the raisins coupled with the brown sugar make it too sweet. I might try substituting some of the brown sugar for flour. The time and temperature also work with just one big tart (I think mine is 9 inches). I also didn't have any nutmeg, and cinnamon was an OK substitute.

These were easy to make, but I found they had too much lemon.  Otherwise, these are good.

i loved this recipe. i doubled it and it made 30 tarts using pre made crusts. if you donâ€™t like lots of lemon, i would suggest using 3T instead of 4T, but i thought it was good with 4. i filled the crusts about 3/4  full and they cooked well.

I love this recipe!!  It's very easy and the only thing I changed is I didn't melt the butter.   It melted in the oven instead ðŸ˜‰Everyone loved these butter tarts!!

Way to much lemon.  Wasnt great. Have 2 cause still edible

Nice simple recipe.  I would not add the Lemon as it left a bitter undertone.  My suggestion would be to use 1/2 the amount of lemon.

I've been using this recipe for years. I always double it and sub some of the raisins for cranberries and cut back on the lemon juice. I sometimes add cinnamon, too. It's my kids favorite.

These don't taste like classic butter tarts, they taste like mincemeat and fruitcake.

I made my own crust and followed someone's suggestion to make one big tart.  It looks  a bit weird but tastes fine and setup well.

I made double the quantity and added pecan. My husband and kids love them.

The lemon totally took over. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever tasted raisin tarts quite like these before
