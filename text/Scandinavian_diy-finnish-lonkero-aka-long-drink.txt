Nice drink! I played around with the proportions a little too much and made it a bit sour, but that's my own fault. Still quite good.

Delicious! Just enough tartness with a touch more lemon juice for my palate.

Try your favorite gin with Mt Dew Ice or MT Dew White Out, I prefer 50/50 but I might pour heavy, 1:2 to 1:1 works just fine. The N.Y. version is more club soda vs the Finnish version has more grapefruit.
