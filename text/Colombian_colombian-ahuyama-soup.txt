I loved this recipe, and so did my mom! I made some changes, though: instead of red pepper flakes, I put in a minced red chili and used Caribbean curry instead of the regular kind. I used milk instead of cream. And I forgot the parsely. I also used about half the broth. It turned out really thick and creamy. I will make it again!

I split the recipe in half and that might lead to why I wasn't so impressed. I personally prefer my soups thicker and this was very broth like so I had to add some flour and extra cream to thicken or just used less broth.  I also had to double the amount of spices and added some of my ownlike ginger.  Good flavor other than that. I like the idea of adding peanut butter to butternut squash.

I had canned a bunch of squash, and was looking for a simple recipe to make a tasty soup. I like this one. I left the cream out though. I did find that this needs salt, so I added 1 tbsp of bullion.

I used 1/4 c peanut butter, 3 cups broth, and 1 cup milk and it came out perfect.  I didn't want it thin like other reviewers said.  I also cut out the butter to get rid of the sodium.

I cut the amount of broth in half, but the soup still tastes very much like just plain broth. I like the way the flavors combine into a hot savory soup.  Because I now know that I prefer chunky soups, when I reheat this, I'll add chicken and more vegetables.
