My sister and I thought we lost my grandmother's recipe when she died only to find it here. I did not add the candied fruit and baked it in a larger spring form pan for 1 hr. It was perfect!

Looks like step 1 and step 2 are the same or did i miss something?

This is the bests

My mother in law made grain pie every Easter and I found this to be just like hers.  The only change I made to this recipe was she  would soak the wheat in cold water in the fridge overnight.  I drained the soaking water and used fresh to cook it.  I did this and it made the wheat softer

I doubled the recipe and it was enough to fill 4 deep dish pies crusts. I omitted the fruit and used a tablespoon of orange extract. This is closest recipe I found to my grandmothers. It's perfect!

I made this exactly the way it said .It was exactly like  I remember when I was young No changes need to be made just cook the wheat berries a bit longer....this was excellent.....

Just the recipe I was looking for!  Perfect Italian Easter pie!

I'm glad this recipe came with instructions on how to prepare the wheat berries.  Coming from NY, the wheat was readily available in the Italian deli's, fully prepared and ready to add to the pie.  Not so in the Midwest.  However, I would definitely cook the wheat berries longer than called for as they were a little too chewy.  Great otherwise!

Love this recipe, this was a family tradition every Easter. Pattie, i think you're talking about a different pie that is not a dessert pie, the pie you're thinking of is more like a quiche pie and it is also delicious, my family always made the Easter bread with the colored Easter egg in the middle or braided with the eggs in between.

good flavor.  I may try different grain next year..maybe tapioca?
