This is a delicious, spicy, quick and easy shrimp appetizer or dinner that is ready in only 10 minutes.  I like a medium spice level and the spice level was just right for me.  If you like a mildly spiced dish, I recommend cutting back on the cayenne.  Next time I think I would like to grill the shrimp instead.  Thanks for sharing the recipe SlimCookins.

I’ve made this a few times and love it cold and tossed into a salad. However I cut back the cayenne a bit… just my taste.  I find that too much cayenne can take over a dish, so you can’t taste anything else. Very versatile and easy. Thank you!

This is AMAZING! Increased the cayenne pepper but other than that, it's perfectly addicting. Super good for diabetics, too!

It was delicious, just the right amount of spice.

I was looking for a quick shrimp recipe that could stand alone without pasta and this did not disappoint!  Realized I was out of Thyme at the last minute and substituted Sage (1/2 the amount), added a little extra Cayenne and it was perfect!  Definitely making again.

Very good. Personally draining the shrimp near the end of the cooking and adding a bit of butter and lemon gave it a bit more flavor. However, my family liked it without my additions.

We added onions and red peppers and served over quinoa. Simple and tasty!

Wow. Really quite good. I like spice and my guy always complains about too much fire. This recipe helped me reign in my heavy spicy hand..Recipe was for 1.5 lbs. I had 2#. Just rounded up a little on our certain tastes preferences. Delish!!

Quick, easy weeknight meal.  I will definitely make it again, though I may add some additional seasonings or at least more of some of the ones already in there.  Though I enjoyed it, I couldn't taste many of the other flavors over the cayenne.

I made this dish but it was with another recipe I already had.
