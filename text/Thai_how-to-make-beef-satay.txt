Initially I used chicken and it was excellent, so then 
I tried it using beef but I made the mistake of marinating it for too long :(  I will certainly make it again however this time I will listen to Chef John's instructions.

I followed this recipe exactly [minus the lemon grass but substituted lemon zest] and the fish sauce is way too overpowering.  I would actually eliminate the fish sauce if you don't care for that 'fishy' taste.

Made it for a potluck, everyone loved it!  I cut the fish sauce in half as I'm not that familiar with it.  The recipe is probably good as is though.  Can't wait to make it again!

Delicious! Penetrating marinade that is sweet and earthy. I initially paired with a peanut sauce and rice but for my taste the meat is better served with a yogurt sauce and flat bread. Will definitely be making again, thank you!

Unfortunately, I didn't realize I was out of fish sauce so I improvised using a tablespoon of oyster sauce, a touch less sugar and 1/4c of water. Of course the flavor profile wasn't  the same but the dish came out well anyway. Broiled the meat in the oven. It's a keeper for me

I stuck to Chef John's recipe and it was wonderful.  The peanut dipping sauce made it even better.  Thanks for sharing, Chef John!

This was so delicious and my family loved it. I made 2 changes: flank steak in place of sirloin, and I quickly pan-fried it without skewers. The peanut sauce was good but I will try Jet Tilaâ€™s next time which includes cocoanut milk and red curry paste. I served it as an appetizer and fried rice as entree

Holy moly!  This was delicious & a gigantic hit wit with my family.  Will definitely make again!

Fantastic flavor.  Tastes like being at a restaurant

great recipe as is, was a big hit as an app at our BBQ

Flavorful, tender and easy.  Fantastic.
