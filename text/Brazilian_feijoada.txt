I haven't made this but while I'm sure this tastes very good, it's not authentic Brazilian. I am Brazilian and we don't ever put tomatoes, jalape単os or cayenne pepper in our feijoada. Jalape単o and cayenne aren't even sold here except in very exclusive markets with imported food and they cost a fortune. Serve with oranges, collard greens, hot sauce, white rice, mandioca frita (fried yuca) and farofa (manioc flour) with pudim de doce de leite (caramel flan) for dessert. :)

Once you get past the tongue (scary for some cooks) you realize this is pretty good. If the tongue is too scary skip it and use sausage, ham hocks, bacon and pork. Then you can ignore the tongue and get to the joy of this dish. I did not use Jalapeno, tomato or the cayenne. I think this is more of a Cuban style black bean dish and I prefer the Brazilian style. I like the recipe that does not use beef or Jalapenos. It is always fun to try new recipes, I just had a hard time going from my fantasy Brazilian black bean to this style.  I like this dish, I won't make it again because I love the pork style better.

I made it with Churizo , Top sirloin , bacon and Tongue.
I left it as a stew rather than separating the meat as described.
we really liked the flavor

Great recipe!
