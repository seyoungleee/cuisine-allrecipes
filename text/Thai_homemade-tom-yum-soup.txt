This was really good and better than I've had in a lot of restaurants too. I made this on a whim and live out in the country where the grocery selection is limited so I had to make a couple of small changes. I used the lemongrass in the tube and also the ginger in a tube instead of "fresh". I must admit that it simplified the recipe because there was nothing to fish out before serving. This was really good and one I would make again.

Simple

This wasn't bad but I'm a bit confused by the 6 servings described here. This made exactly 1 bowl of soup for two of us. I also only used a teaspoon of chili sauce and that felt plenty spicy.  A tablespoon would have been too much!
