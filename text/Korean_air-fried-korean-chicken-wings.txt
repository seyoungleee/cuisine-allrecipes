These were outstanding!  I LOVE that I don't have to oil fry these wings!  The only change I made was to add the dried spices to the cornstarch and mix it in well.  That way, the coating had spices all through it.  I've made these a dozen time and they disappear almost immediately.

Loved it! Thank you for the recipe

I did not cook these wings in an air fryer.  I baked in the oven on Convection Roast 400 degrees for 40 minutes.  Placed the wings on a rack and turned 1/2 way thru the cooking time.  I also took the leftover marinade and cooked it over medium heat for 20 minutes and tossed the wings in the cooked marinade.  Topped with chopped green onions and toasted sesame seeds.  Delicious!

Very spicy. But very tasty.

These are by far the best wings I’ve made let alone probably have ever had. Follow the recipe exactly and you won’t be disappointed. They are quite spicy so if you don’t want that much of a kick use regular honey instead of the hot honey.

The only change I made to this recipe is that I substituted plain honey for the spicy honey. This was done only because I didn't have any spicy honey. The wings came out so incredibly good. They instantly became my family's favorite chicken wings. I will be making this recipe for many years to come.

This was absolutely delicious! I look forward to making it again. I didn’t have scallions but that did t detract from it. It’s messy but finger licking good!  Was just as good as the wings I’d get at a local Korean restaurant!

Recipe was great, the only change I would make which I guess I should have known make the sauce when chicken wings are almost cooked.

Yes, it was delicious!

We are a household of food allergies, I'm allergic to meat and my daughter can't have soy.  So the only adjustments that I made were, I made this with Salmon and nixed the soy sauce from the recipe. 
 Instead of soy sauce, I used Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce and it tasted good.
