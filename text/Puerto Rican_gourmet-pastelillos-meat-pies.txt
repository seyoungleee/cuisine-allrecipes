These turned out great!!! The only thing I added was a half a slice mozzarella cheese to each but that was only by preference.

I made it exactly as written except I used my air fryer to cook. 350 degrees for 10 minutes in batches. We like these pretty stuffed so I ran out of stuffing with quite a few wrappers left. I grabbed some ham and cheese from the fridge, whipped up a quick honey mustard and used the rest of them.
