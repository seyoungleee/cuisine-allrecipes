I made this dish tonight; it turned out awesome.  I had some mushrooms I was looking to use and sauteed them with the shallots and garlic.  

One step that should be added is to reserve one cup of the pasta water, which should be added just prior to adding the pasta and shrimp.  This adds starch and helps give the sauce a smooth texture.

Very tasty, was a tad dry. I'd recommend adding 1/2 - 1 cup of the pasta water to keep it moist.

Made it for dInner last night. It was a hit. My husband went back for seconds. I personally would double the sauce and add a little more lemon

This was delicious!  I'm not a fan of red pepper flakes so I omitted those.  I like fresh mushrooms so I added those when I sauted scallots and garlic.  I was out of olive oil so I made the entire recipe with unsalted butter.  Fresh grated parmasean to top it off was wonderful.  New favorite 30 minute meal.

Let me just say…..WOW! This is going down in the family favorites recipe book! I did tweak it just a bit. I used 2 lbs of large shrimp and it was the perfect ratio of pasta/shrimp. I ended up using extra butter and olive oil at the end and also some grated Parmesan cheese and garlic salt to taste and added 2 cups of the pasta water. Everything else I used per the recipe. My hubby and 2 boys absolutely loved it, and keep asking me when I’m going to make it again. This will be a weekly meal for sure!

I substituted small cheese tortellini for the linguine, it was phenomenal. Also, I used chicken broth instead of the white wine.

Nothing tasted fine thanks

1/3 less pasta & only half a lemon is my suggestion. I had to add broth because it was too dry and too lemony.

Bland definitely needs more butter and less pasta.

We loved the recipe. I did, however add extra garlic because we also love garlic perfect and delicious.

This recipe was as so good even my picky kid ate it!! It was my 46th birthday dinner and I celebrated in style thanks to this recipe!
