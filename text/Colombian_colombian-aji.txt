I really enjoyed this. A good friend of mine is Columbian and offered this as a alternative to chimichurri. It has WAAY less fat than chimichurri and it tastes great. It is better to make it ahead of time though. That way the flavors have time to mix. I grilled a flank steak and used this on the steak after it was cooked. Thanks!

Love it!

Very flavorful and not spicy in my opinion.

I've made about 6 batches of this.  Love it!  This latest time I left out the water and I added 4 habeneros to kick it up a notch.  Best batch yet.

Perfect!

Isn't this Peruvian Aji though? I always thought Columbian Aji contained tomatoes and Peruvian Aji was more like this. This is tasty, but I prefer lime over lemon and will use limes instead next time.

OMG t5his is so good!.  I was very skeptical but I decided to make it for South American Pot luck.   I did add about 4 cloves of garlic and subbed 1/2 of a red onion and a shallot because I didn't have green onions.  kept everything else the same.  It has a  great bright flavor and I can't wait to bring it tomorrow.  We just ate it on chips.  It would be fantastic on steak or a steak taco, fish or shrimp taco too.

Loved it! We grow jalape√±os in our garden. Needed a recipe that called for a lot of peppers since I didn't want them to go bad. This was perfect! Wonderful taste & we were able to freeze what we didn't use. Will definitely make over & over again

My Colombian friends fell in love with this recipe. They can't get enough of it. I made one change that they liked . I use a 1-1 blend of pasilla and jalapeno peppers. Gives a bit more flavor and a bit less heat. The final product needs to be on the salty side.

will make again with less vinegar next time.
