Very good!!! I couldn't find the pork rinds so I crisped 3 bacon strips and ground them up. I also put about 1 tsp of butter in the mix together with the olive oil. YUMMMYYYYY

I love this dish, served with traditional rice and beans.  I add some Adobo for a little kick.

I substituted the oil to an oil of my preference which made no change to the taste of the end product.

Delicious

Didn't ave porkrinds so  used bacon. Would not keep its ball shape.

Absolutely delicious and very flavorful.

Easy and delicious!  Had all the ingredients for the recipe and some left over Puerto Rican red beans I made so decided to combine the two.  Traditional I would serve with stewed shrimp but was also great with the beans. 

Added a pinch of salt to the motar making it easier to crush the garlic,  added a few  plantains  at a time as I mashed with the pork rinds .   The salt from the rinds is more than enough to season the dish.

Will make over and over again!!

I suggest you find the correct type of green plantains. They need to actually be more like green bananas than the sweet plantains you know. When you are done, you can put the mortar upside down in the oven at low heat until the food becomes loose from the mortar. Another thing that can be done if you are not liking the slight spice or sting of garlic, is to put the whole cloves to cook in a small amount of oil for a little bit. After that you can crush it in the mortar and pestle. I will cook it again and continue to modifying it as I go. If I find the perfect mix I will share it here.

Loved this! It was like a trip back to the DR.

The plantains should be green unripe.
