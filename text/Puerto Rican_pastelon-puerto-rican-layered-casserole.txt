I made this without string beans for my Puerto Rican boyfriend. I ended up with 3 layers instead of two, and used 4 large sweet plantains. It came out really well, the only suggestion I have is that it needs closer to 35 minutes in the oven in order for the egg to set.

Good minus green beans. I added cumin to meat. Made homemade sofrito, added green peppers to meat,  crushed tomatoes & tomatoe paste, and  boil plantains instead. Mashed  6 plantains with butter & adobo seasoning. Only 2 eggs with parsley flakes mix. Delicious n yummy. No raisins added like it's done traditionally.

Delicious!

This Puerto Rican plate name is Piñon. When you mashed the plantains you called it pastelon.  The real recipe of the Piñon doesn't have cheese, but if you like it go ahead still delicious.

First time making Pastelon, it turned out great. Thanks for the easy to follow recipe!

It was well received by all who tried it - Puerto Rican or otherwise. I will definitely make it again.
