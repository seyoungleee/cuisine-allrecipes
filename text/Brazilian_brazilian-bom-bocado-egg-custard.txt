I don't know what these are supposed to taste like. Having said that I can say that I really liked these. They're like a cross between a macroon and an egg custard. I noticed that they almost formed 2 layers,  coconut baked at the top and the custard at the bottom.  I baked them in my mini muffin tins and I wound up with 24 not 12. The timing was way off, took 18 minutes for them to turn a golden brown. All in all, very easy to make.

Yummy. Super easy!!! I had extra cans of sweetened condensed milk left over from Christmas I needed to use. So I searched here to find something quick and easy for dinner. We love macaroons, flan, custard, cream brûlée so this looked great....and it was!  I shared a pic of going in oven along with a shrimp casserole. I love it when I can bake two dishes at the same time!  I did increase baking time to 20 minutes.

These lovely custard morsels were just the right size after a rich meal. I loved the texture and the coconut flavour, and they are so quick and easy to make!
