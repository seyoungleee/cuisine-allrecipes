These are delicious. I made a few changes to fit my taste: 1 T of salt and 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (1 T. cayenne would have been to spicy for me). For the dough I used a simple recipe of 3 c. flour, 1/2 t. salt, 3/4 c. butter (12 T.), 1 egg, 1/4 c. water.  I rolled my dough thin,used a small bowl of 5 3/4" diameter for a pattern to cut out discs and then put 1/4 c. filling in each empanada. It made 26 empanadas with just little dough leftover.
