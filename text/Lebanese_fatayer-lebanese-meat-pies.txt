The simple steak and onion filling is so gooooodddd. I ate my fair share of bites while I was assembling these tasty meat pies. The pre-made bread dough makes this a quick recipe - though the shaping of the Fatayer took a little finagling for me to start figuring out, and most of mine broke open during baking because they weren't sealed tightly enough. Regardless, they were delicious!
