I used a small tenderloin from Trader Joe's and so cut the recipe to 3 servings.  I gave a healthy dose of the salt and pepper but kept everything else the same.  The next time I would press the garlic rather than mince it so that it would make a better paste on the meat.  At 425 degrees it took about 23 minutes after I'd taken the meat from the fridge about a half hour before baking it.  At the very end I turned on the broiler to make the color a little better.  This is a very easy and very tasty meal.  Thanks for our dinner tonight!

Rub was tasty but didn't really penetrate the into the meat.  I followed another reviewer's advice to rub the outside of the tenderloin with olive oil prior to adding the rub.

Such a crowd pleaser! No changes needed, and it’s a quick and easy recipe to do on busy nights.

I made it with a minor addition. After I mixed the spices I coated the tenderloin with olive oil. Then coated the meat with the mixture.  I roasted it as directed.  My wife loved it.  It was very tasty and moist. It was easy and delicious.  Thank you, I will make it again!

This was so bland and dry.  My family couldn’t eat it.  It smelled great while cooking but tasted so so bland.  Disappointed to waste pork tenderloin

reduced salt to 1/2 tsp on 2 lb tenderloin. Used Herbs de Provence when I found I had no oregano. Sprayed olive oil on loins before adding seasonings.

Loved it.  So tender and flavorful.

Very tasty and easy recipe,needed about 10 more minutes of cooking time.

I really loved this as a quick and easy supper.  The combination of spices rubbed into the tenderloin was perfect.  I served it with broccoli and some stovetop stuffing mix and the family loved it.

I used this recipe when I made my first-ever pork loin this week, and it turned out great, in spite of the fact the the one I bought was bigger and figuring out how much longer to cook was a bit of guess-work. I'll definitely be making this one again.
