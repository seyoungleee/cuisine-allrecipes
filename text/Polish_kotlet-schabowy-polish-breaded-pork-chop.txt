I have made both pork chops and chicken breasts like this, however i only brown them with the above ingredients then bake them in the oven for about an hour st 325 adding a spoonful of water to each chop or breast prior to covering with foil.  Comes out extremely tender and juicy.

ok

Was so simple to make!  I served it with a side as Knorrs Rice Medley.    We definitely will have this again

I just made this last night - I had 2 really thick boneless pork chops so cut in half to make thinner ones.  Then pound and continue on with recipe.  The only difference is this is Oma's German Schnitzel!!!

This is how I make my pork chops. Crispy . I will pound them thinner as I donâ€™t do that yetðŸ˜Š

I have used this recipe for years. I tweak it up and add fresh grated parmesan cheese and Italian spices and serve it up like chicken parm. So good, so easy!

I love this recipe.  I did add garlic powder, salt & pepper to the seasoned bread crumbs. Just a personal preference.  I had never pounded boneless pork chops into cutlets before.  They were really good!ðŸ˜‹

To add more flavor I marinade tenderized meat overnight in eggs with minced garlic and salt.  Omit  flour and coat in bread crumbs before frying. Yummy.

very good basic recipe.  my mother (not polish) always made pork chops and chicken cutlets this way.  i added garlic powder and dried parsley to the salt and pepper.  i had to guess at the size of the chop since the recipe doesn't tell you that and the weight determines the calories you're consuming.  is there any guidance on that?

Just like my grandma used to make.  I sauteed garlic in the oil first then salt and peppered them and added the coating.  They turned out really good.  Grandma taught me the garlic lightly browned in the oil first gives it all just a little added punch. Thanks for giving me back an old recipe from the old country.
