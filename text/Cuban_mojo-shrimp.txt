followed as written; citrus "cooks" shrimp, so not surprised that shrimp was a bit dry and chewy. I served with broccoli, and the sauce on broccoli was delicious. Sauce/marinade is really tasty and could be great in other dishes as well. For fish, cut the marinating time, in my opinion.

Loved it. Easy and very tasty.

The orange juice made the dish.  We have many shrimp recipes and this one gets added to them.

Delicious
 added Mahi-mahi
Juice

I made it with Black Bean and Corn Salad and Rice w/ mixed vegetables. I cut the shrimp into smaller pieces after cooking.
