Really good. I omitted the sugar because it was sweet enough already, and I used garlic chilli sauce as that's what I had on hand. This is a very customizable recipe - would work great with different meat and veggies. Thanks!

I can't stand the brown sugar, sweet chili sauce, And Ketchup. I think when you fry rice it should be fried, not just heated up in a pan.

Very yummy dish!

Was a huge hit with my family! Will be making again. I used shrimp because that's what I had, but otherwise cooked as written.

My first attempt at fried rice and my family loved it!  Added some heat but otherwise stayed true to the recipe.

Outstanding.  Could substitute about any seafood with similar results.

My husband and I really like this recipe.  It is a take on regular fried rice, and really does have a Malaysian flavor.  I almost always use the vegetables suggested, but find that you can use a variety of veggies.

delicious"! flavoursome, quick - and doesn't need any tinkering with, Thanks for sharing!

Loved it!  I made it last night for my wife and parents and they all raved about it.  I did however, leave out the brown sugar completely, and went a bit easier on the ketchup.  I also found myself adding a BIT more soy sauce after it was served.  Not TOO much though.  Also, if you're a hot sauce fan, you can't go wrong piling it onto this dish! :-D

This was so good!  My 2 kids and husband devoured it.  We will definitely do this again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.
