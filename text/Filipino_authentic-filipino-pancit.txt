This recipe is great! I was originally going to shred the cabbage and carrots, but I followed the recipe. Their size and texture goes well with the noodles and shredded chicken. Saving the chicken broth to soak the noodles makes it more flavorful. Easy meal to make.

I've never had pancit before but was interested when I found this recipe, so I tried it; and it's really, really good! I'm definitely going to be making this again!I omitted onions and added more cabbage/carrots to make up for it (plus a little extra bc I like more veg in my dishes); everything else was done exactly as the recipe asks for.

My first time cooking it! I think it turned out great.

Good basic recipe! I added some ginger, fish sauce and oyster sauce at the end and it was awesome

Great for beginner.  Added a splash of Datu Puri vinegar and made it even better

After always relying on my Filipino neighbors for pancit, I decided to try to make my own. This was the first pancit recipe I tried and I loved it. I made it again using a different recipe (I couldn't find this one again), and it wasn't nearly as good. I've found this receipe again and this time I'm saving it! It's delicious!
