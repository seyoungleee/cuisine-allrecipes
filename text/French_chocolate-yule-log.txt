substituted 1 pkg cream cheese + 1/3 cup sour cream for mascarpone, and added 1 tsp vanilla for filling.

The cake is easy to work with and roll when you follow the directions on the video, which is a big help.  the filling is not overly sweet, and is perfect.  I added a teaspoon of coffee to the mixture for a mocha flavor.  The ganache was delicious, just make it cool enough and whip it enough to spreading consistency.  I will be making this next Christmas!

Loved it - itâ€™s a commitment with all the steps but so worth it! I too added marscapone  to the whipped cream to stabilize.

This recipe was a big hit!I added raspberry filling.Get ready for lots of oooohs and ahhhhs - SO festive and delish!!

Absolutely awesome!!! Rave reviews from everyone I just embellished with home made meringue mushrooms and sugared rosemary & cranberries

The video by Chef John was fantastic and helped immensely in making this! The log came out beautiful but dry. I could have over baked it  as this was my first time making sponge cake. I actually used a piping bag for the ganache and was very happy with the results although for some that may be too heavy in the frosting. The mocha buttercream was AMAZING!! Thank you for the great video to help with this recipe!

This is a rich and decadent treat, with a buttercream to die for. I added some chocolate bark and meringue mushrooms and my family were all in awe. It was probably my greatest culinary achievement. :)

I loved this recipe ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°. The instructions were very good. It was really helpful to have the video resource while I was preparing the log. Highly  recommend. My only hiccup was the ganache. It was a bit too liquidy after setting on the countertop all night. Added more chocolate but then ended up too thick. Still used it but making the "bark"  with the knife was hard. I have never made ganache so I chalked that up to being a beginner. Using plenty of powered sugar is definitely a good idea. The only changes I made were 1) using frangelica instead of kahlua, which was delicious,  and 2) using espresso mascarpone bc that's what the grocery store had. It is mild flavored so no problem. Used mistletoe to decorate but might try meringue mushrooms next time. It's a little time consuming but if you want to up your baking skills, I would recommend this recipe.

The frosting was delicious but there was barely enough to cover the cake with only a very thin layer. I don't even understand how the chef's note says it was too much frosting and that they would only use 2/3 of it. Needs at least 1.5 X's if not double. My cake also turned out a tiny bit dry and cracked in a few places after the frosting was on and I had to roll it back up. Not sure what I did wrong there. I did watch the video and set an alarm for exactly 15 minutes to unroll, frost, and roll it back up. Despite these couple of small problems, the end result turned out very tasty and beautiful. I appreciated the video, it was extremely helpful. You have to let the ganache cool quite a bit before using if you don't want it to drip. Once it's chilled a bit and thicker it's perfect for spreading. I was able to work with it after about 20-30 minutes in the fridge.

This recipe was the worst!  I wasted the sponge ingredientsâ€¦came out like a pancake. Greasy parchment paper.  Just awful!
