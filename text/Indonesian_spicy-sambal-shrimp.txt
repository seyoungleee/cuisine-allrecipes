I needed to make dinner and I had Sambal Oelek and Uncle Ben's Rice in the fridge, along with frozen Trader Joe's shrimp. I thought, "What can I do with this?" and randomly found this recipe. Hurrah for random recipes! Really delicious and I will cook it again, probably soon. 

1. Don't use Uncle Ben's rice, save that for Thanksgiving or dinner with your parents. This would taste great with basmati rice or jasmine. 
2. I did not have  green onions and look forward to throwing them in next time!
3. I used a 1/3 cup of the Sambal Oelek and even that was almost too spicy for me. In the future, I'll take it down a notch or two - maybe a 1/4 cup. The lesson here? Adjust to your taste and heat level. And if you can handle the 1/2 cup of Sambal, good on you! 
4. So much butter in this recipe! Which makes it super yummy but not that super healthy. I'll be swapping some of the butter out for olive, coconut, or even avocado oil.

did not put as much Sambal in as they said, about 1/2 and it was spicy enough for us.

Super taste, fantastically easy!  This is going to become a weeknight staple!

Made as is, not bad, a mild spiciness to it

Made as directed except didn't use green onions and used extra garlic. Was very tasty and quick to make. The sambal amount was just right and the aroma was mouthwatering. Only thing it was too oily from all the butter. I did thaw the shrimp as directed and it worked!! Thanks for the tip. Will make again and maybe replace part of the butter with broth or not. It was really good as is. Thanks for the recipe!

Made as written except that I could not find sushi rice in my supermarket and just used minute rice instead. It worked great and if you do the rice while the shrimp are cooking, it can be on your dinner table in 10 minutes. The recipe didn't specify but you need to use raw shrimp instead of the already cooked. Beware, this is spicy spicy so if you are sensitive to heat, this is not for you. If you like spice, this is perfect!
