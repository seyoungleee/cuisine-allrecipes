I've tried one other recipe for Finnish pancakes, and I like this one way better.  What made this recipe is the preheating of the butter in the pan--thus giving the pancake batter a better rise. These pancakes are similar to Dutch or German pancakes, but not quite as puffy--due to the amount of milk to egg ratio. Still a good flavor and texture, however. The lemon and cardamom are really wonderful additions. I baked this in a 9x13" pan for 23 minutes and it was perfect. Served with some blueberry jam. It was delicious! Thank you for the recipe!
