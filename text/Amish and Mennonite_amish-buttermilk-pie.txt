I thought this was a delight. Simple to put together and the result was great.  I though the lemon flavor was very good.  My lemon loving family said they thought it could be even more lemon-y.  Next time I’ll bump up the extract a smidge.  I used a rolled refrigerated pie crust and pressed it into a 10 in tart pan. Reduced the bake time by 10 minutes.  I sprinkled some powdered sugar on top.  VERY GOOD RECIPE!

This had more than “a hint of lemon” - it was very lemony and I didn’t even use the lemon extract. I like lemon, so I enjoyed it but others may find it a little to lemony. Otherwise, it had a very good texture and the buttermilk made for a good custard pie.

We all loved the pie as after a big Easter dinner it was a great lite dessert to have. It is easy to make .

Sounds delicious ....and I loved buttermilk pie cooked right as does my son! Wish me luck baking it!

Oh my, found the receipt that a great aunt use to make many years ago.
