These cookies did not cook at 300 for 10 minutes.  They were pure dough.  I cooked them longer and they still did not cook through.  Put them in at 350 for an additional 5 minutes and they cooked but the cookie is too flakey and falls apart to easily.  Too much cornstarch.  What a waste of time and ingredients.

These cookies turned out well.  The cookie itself is very soft.  The filling was delightful.  If I bake these again, I will probably change the vodka with almond extract.
