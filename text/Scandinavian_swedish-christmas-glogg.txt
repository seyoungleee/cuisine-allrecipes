I agree, add cardamon seed 1T. This is the greatest drink in the world on a cold, snowy night! The house will smell AMAZING!!!!! Put away the air freshener, put on a great holiday movie and snuggle into a big easy chair with your fluffiest jammies, slippers and blanket when you have a huge, warm cup of this stuff! Did I paint enough of a tempting pic for you? Good, now go make some, and tell the kids to eat the cookies you baked and stop bothering you for a glass of what you're having :-D LOL

Very good glogg recipe. I make this every winter and keep it in the fridge so I can warm up a cup whenever I want. I wait until after heating my cup to add the brandy or rum. It is awesome with apple brandy!

Potent and delicious! I omitted the raisins.

Instead of sliced orange peel, used orange zest and skimmed it off before serving. Tastes just like the Gl√ºgg served to me in Copenhagen last year! Excellent!

Very good and much easier than the other recipes I found. I used a Zinfandel v a lighter wine.

Made it for my annual St Lucia party (my mom used to make it but she has pased away and I couldn't read her mom's recipe because it's in Swedish)... and it was a big hit, even with my Swedish relatives. Followed i mostly to the letter, though threw in a few more cloves, and actually used two-buck chuck merlot along with a decent bottle of port. This will be my annual recipe for glogg from now on - thank you!

I made this last year at Thanksgiving and a few years ago at Christmas. pretty much the same except for I used a half a cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar and I use about a cup of Brandy ??. it came out great!

Yum.  Made with a sweet/dry wine so left out port.  Added the Cardamon as suggested.  Made the rest of the recipe as is.  Oh so good.  Just the thing during a snow storm to warm us up.

This is a delicious recipe as is.  I actually prefer to use red table wine in place of the port because port + all of that sugar is just too sweet for me.  In fact, I typically use red table wine and only 1/4 cup of sugar.  I also prefer not to add the brandy.  It is SUPER strong with just the wine and the rum.  Depending on who I serve it to, I would leave the rum as is for those who like stronger drinks, but when my parents come over, I reduce the rum a bit.  The smell of this drink is amazing.  It's perfect for Christmas evening!!!
