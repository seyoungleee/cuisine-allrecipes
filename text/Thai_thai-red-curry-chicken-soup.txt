I used my turkey carcass boiled down for the broth and meat then used Tika Masala Sauce as I couldn't find curry paste. I added more curry powder and turmeric to make up. I served the soup with Naan Bread, cilantro on top with a dust of red pepper. It was great.

I loved it! It reminded me so much of a great little Thai restaurant in Orlando, FL that I used to frequent. I added red pepper flakes and zucchini to it chopped up and cooked it for the 15 minute simmer.That's how that restaurant served it but as a main dish not a soup. Sooo good tho. Thanks.

Fast and easy to make!!!! Husband loved it.  I did double the curry paste just because I love it.  Enjoy and make sure you use the cilantro.

Took considerably longer to prep then the description said it would, but maybe that’s my lack of kitchen finesse. I doubled the recipe so I’d have leftovers-glad I did. Added extra curry paste as suggested by other reviews and added mushrooms which worked well. Great simple recipe!

Added mushrooms more peppers and will up the paste next time…yummy

Simply delicious! Easy, fresh ingredients and everybody’s loves it !!!

Very easy to prepare and very tasty! I used all the same ingredients and doubled the red curry paste as I like a good kick. Will make again!

Fantastic - easy to prepare -I cooked the thighs in Instant Pot and then did the rest of the work on the stove top.    I did double the curry as recommended in a few other reviews.  We definitely will be making this again.  Thanks to the author.

I made it as directed except I used store-bought chicken stock. I think it could have been spicier, but everyone else thought it was perfect.

We liked this so much I made it twice in one week.  I did add a small amount of red pepper flakes the second time for a little more zing.  Delicious, thanks for a new favorite!  We invited friends to come for dinner tomorrow and guess what we're serving!
