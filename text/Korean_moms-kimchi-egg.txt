I am new to eating kimchi and was looking for ideas and came across this recipe. So good and so simple. I will be having this for breakfast often. Thank you so much!

Better yet, use ghee, get eggs started on low heat, then when half way done add a cup of kimchi and gently fold to heat without over heating. Im just thinking of the pro or prebiotics, and that gramma always said to cook eggs slow. Eating it right now. No rice but so good. Im glad others are eating. I get my kimchi from costco and its what got me started. Haven't made it and might not, but i always feel so good for eating it. Cheersü§óüëçüíì

So. Darn. Good. I added spinach, cheddar cheese, and pepper jack cheese. Will def be making again!

This was excellent. I've never had cooked kimchi before and for some reason the eggs came out not only fluffy but tasting a little cheesy which I thought was excellent. I did add some black pepper as other people mentioned I highly recommend this recipe

I also doubled the amount of eggs for this recipe. Next time I will chop the kimchi up smaller into more manageable bites as well. I love kimchi but usually can‚Äôt eat much because the carbonation combined with spiciness hurts my tongue. Cooking it first makes it more mild yet it was still every bit as delicious!

super delicious and so easy! it will definitely be in regular rotation!

Added yellow peppers and some hot sauce at the end. Yummmyyyyy

Outstanding. I also make kimchi rice‚Ä¶which is wonderful.  This was almost as good and less carbs. I used ghee for my oil. So delish!

So easy, so good, the changes I made; a piece of buttered sourdough toast along side w/coffee

This is a delicious and easy to make recipe! I added fresh mushrooms to the Kimchi when heating, and added fresh black pepper and smoked jalape√±o powder to the eggs, turned out fantastic with a sprinkle of cheddar on top! You can do almost anything with this recipe.
