I am doing this for a project for school it is very easy to make and smells good! It tasted really good for the time it took

It was okay. Probably will cut garlic to 2 cloves next time

I think lemon might be a lime because in Brazil they call a lime a lemon vise versa just a thought to this recipe or they use scilian lemon which is kinda like in the US

Super easy and everyone loved it. I am making it again this as it is a favorite already. Might add just a few red pepper flakes to ad a little kick
