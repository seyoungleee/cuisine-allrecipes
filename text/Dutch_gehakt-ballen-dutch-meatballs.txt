Recipe was delicious except for the amount of nutmeg. One whole tablespoon of nutmeg is way too much. Next time I would use 1 teaspoon at most.

Worse recipe I've used!
Just wasted $14.00 in meat. Had 2 lbs of meat. WAY too much nutmeg and cloves. Please adjust recipe so other do not waste their money.

I stumbled onto this recipe and it awoke fond memories of the meals I  enjoyed as a  child.  All my mothers Dutch recipes were stored in her head, very few were ever written down. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Loved this recipe! My husband said just like his Omaâ€™s. He  preferred no diced tomatoes, I loved the tomato (I made two batches one with and one without)
