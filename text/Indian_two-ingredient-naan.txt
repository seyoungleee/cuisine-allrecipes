No reviews so figured I'd offer my 2 cents. I used more Greek yogurt than the recipe called for so had to use more flour as well. Knead your mixture with more flour as you go to get the right consistency. Turned out just how I wanted once I got there! You can add more salt to taste/I also added garlic powder

Super Smokey even on medium heat.  Not great taste.

My Pakistani husband would have loved these, daughter and I agree they are AMAZING, added a generous amount of garlic powder. Going to experiment with different seasonings. Satisfying and so much less expensive than the store bout or restaurant.

Made this yesterday. Was a little more chewy than the naan I prefer. My son, helped, he thought it was good.

So easy, and so delicious!  My family loves this recipe.

I've made this twice now and it is so easy. I ran out of yogurt and used sour cream the second time which worked great.

Followed the dough directions verbatim. Added about 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic and the finely minced tops of 6-7 green onions. They puffed up beautifully with a tender interior and a slightly crisped crust. They went well with the leftover red lentil soup and romaine salad. This recipe is now in my Keepers collection.

Quick, easy and light and delicious.  I wonâ€™t be buying naan or pitta bread again.

Made it with Honey Yogurt (It is what I use to make overnight oats) so it turned out sweet.  It was so good!  Just a light taste of sweetness that made me want a cup of coffee with it.  I would make this for a grab and go breakfast item for sure.

It comes out so tasty just for two ingredients, wow, so glad I found this recipe because I've been buying Naan at Costco in large batches to have at home, now I can make my own!

I thought this was an easy recipe and everyone in the family loved it.  In a pinch I would make this again.
