I bought these ground cherries in Mennonite country in Pennsylvania, while visiting my son.  I was told they make a great pie, but I had no recipe.  Luckily, thru "all recipes", I found this recipe.  It was delicious.  I might cut down on the sugar if I'm lucky enough to get any more of these ground cherries - but it was a treat.

A little too sweet for me, eating raw ground cherries as is was much more satisfying.

Filling needed more flour. I used 3 tablespoons with the brown sugar.

YUM!

We made this with the ground cherries we grew in our garden and had frozen.  A definite keeper...it tastes something like a caramel apple pie.

I cut the sugar by a third. It was wonderful and you could really taste the Ground Cherries.

Used 4 cups ground cherries. Turned out great, just like moms when I was a kid. Will absolutely be making this again. Thanks

I made this pie yesterday and it was tasty but a little bit too sweet and runny so will decrease the sugar and increase the flour.

got a couple of pints of ground cherries from my CSA and didn't know what to do with them.  this recipe was enjoyed by the whole family.  really delicious -- reminds me of a peach cobbler almost and it was very easy. i did follow another reviewer's advice and cut the brown sugar to 1/3 of a cup and it was perfect!  Will definitely make again if I get some more ground cherries.  thank you for sharing this recipe!

Good.  I like them better in a pie than fresh.  Easy pie.

WAY TOO SWEET! Got the ground cherries at the farmers market, they are delicious. I wanted a traditional recipe but the fruit is too sweet on its own for the amount of sugar in the recipe. I'll get more ground cherries if they have them next week but only for snacking.
