This recipe was very authentic and very close to what we were used to eating when we lived in Russia.  My kids who were born in Russia and grew up eating Russian foods love this, but it might not go over so well with American kids.  We love this, and I make it with all kinds of cooked meat in the traditional Russian fashion, in Russia Solianka is the "clean out your fridge" soup.

Not tasty enough for me for all the unhealthy ingredients.
