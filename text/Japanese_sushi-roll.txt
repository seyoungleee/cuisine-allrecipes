the hardest part of any sushi recipe is finding a bamboo mat... for a long time mine would come out bulky and uneven and generally not pretty. It's hard to roll sushi with just your hands - the nori rips if you press too hard and the roll coomes apart if not hard enough. The easiest thing to do if you cant find a bamboo mat is use a clean dish towel. To get the meat and other stuff right in the center of the roll, position it 3/4 down on the rice, rather than the center. Just some sushi tricks I've learned these past few years ^^

My husband and I LOVE sushi, but this rice was WAY too sweet.  I suggest cutting back on the sugar big time.  I will stick to my original recipe.

Beautiful

Its pretty much the same as I do, except I use fresh fish. And I lay out plastic wrap to roll it up.
