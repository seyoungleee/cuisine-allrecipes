I followed the recipe as indicated but I would say you have to cook the yucca for more than 15 mins because mine was still hard.

Its o.k. In Puerto Rico we would add to that sauces sugar, fresh orange juice, cilantro, black pepper, fresh lime juice, butter and vinegar.

Gotta say is indeed delicious but mine turned out dry ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, might have to boil the cassava a little longer, maybe 20 minutes.

Incredible! I bought some organic yuca from Amazon last week and this recipe was a great way to use it! Will repeat.

Cooking time is variable.  The important thing is to cook until tender.  Lime and cylantro are great additions, but you can bump it up a notch by using peperoncini brine.  Serving with black beans is a must, which I guess makes me reveal my Cuban bias!

So easy to make and excellent taste.  Will be using it repeatedly!!!!

Very Yummy, perfect with my spicy tuna steaks.

Based on the comments of others, I added an extra 10-15 min for boiling the yuca.  And, as another poster suggested, I tried the "Puerto Rican" addition of sweet (in my case, I used honey), butter, cilantro, lime juice & vinegar. It worked out really well. I served it with green beans and pork spiced with Sazon (a Latin American spice mixture sold in most large grocery stores).

It was awesome!!! Better than restaurants. I did cook the yucca about 35 minutes though

I added much more garlic and lime juice, other than that, I stuck to the recipe and it turned out great

You definitely have to cook the yucca longer.  I cooked mine for 45 minutes. but I guess it depends on how thick the pieces are.
