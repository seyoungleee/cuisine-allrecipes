Awesome! I marinated a thinly sliced pork tenderloin for about 3 hours, then drained the meat reserving the marinade. Stir-fried the meat over high heat in a large skillet until nicely browned then added the reserved marinade plus some water to deglaze the pan (& glaze the meat!)
Served on a bed of thinly sliced cabbage that had been sauteed with onion in wok oil until tender (with a little dark sesame oil for more flavor). A bit of soy sauce was added to the cabbage right before plating.

This didn't have a lot of flavour. Kind of salty with a slight ginger taste but that's it.

Everyone loved it. I made it for a family get together.  They begged me to make it again.

It was good I added more ginger the 2nd time, and simmered some sake, soy sauce and ginger to pour overtop. Mmmm thanks.

Needs garlic and green onions.  And a bit of sugar or honey.

Based on reviews, I gave this recipe a try, added extra ginger, marinated overnight, grilled instead of fried... and it was OK, a bit bland.

Delicious! Savory and flavorful and juicy.

Turned out amazing, I didn’t use oil (trying to cut a few calories) but still turned out great. I’m sure it would be better with the little extra crisp of the frying.

Definitely a fantastic, easy dinner! I doubled the marinade. After the pork was browned, I splashed in some water with the marinade, dumped it in the hot pan and reduced it down to a syrup like consistency.

Very flavourful!

Very simple and easy to make plus Healthy and Delicious. I would highly recommend to anyone interested to give it a try!
