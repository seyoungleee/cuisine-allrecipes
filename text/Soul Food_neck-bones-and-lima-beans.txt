I've been cooking great dishes for the past 30 years, and I have to say without a doubt, this is one of the best country meals I have ever had.  I didn't have dry limas, so I used a frozen pack I had in the freezer, and waited until the neck bones were tender before adding them.  I was concerned  about how I would like the sage and netmeg, but they weren't  overwhelming in flavor, but mildly blended in with everything else.   This is a keeper!

I'm so sorry, but this was not good for us. I followed the directions exactly, and the flavor was okay. The meat fell off the bones all right, but then we had a mess of lima beans, meat and tiny bones all mixed together. Did I do something wrong?

So so delicious! After it had cooked about 3/4 of the way, I thought it had kind of a bitter tasteâ€¦ Maybe from the nutmeg, so I added about 2 teaspoons of Monk fruit and that took the bitter taste awayâ€¦ It was delicious

I made this recipe. However , I put less then half of a teaspoon of cayenne. My smoked neck bones and lima beans came out tasty and great .I also made white rice. Yummy ðŸ˜‹Thanks for a great recipe. Normally my smoked neck bones and lima beans come out kind of bland , no matter what seasonings  that I add.Thanks again for a great recipe - keep posting your great recipes.

It was delicious! I normally use a crock pot, but it wasn't available. But the recipe put a little different spin. Will do it again

My family loved an one of my Grandsons who doesnâ€™t eat leftovers, ate a second helping. They requested I make it again.
I added diced jalapeÃ±os to the recipe so yummy added additional flavor.

This turned out so good!  Made it last month and followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only thing different was that I used frozen green Lima beans because the grocery store didnâ€™t have dried white Lima beans.  My husband loved it, and heâ€™s picky!  Headed to the store now so can make it again.  That prompted me to write this review.

No changes, very good.

Yes, I definitely made changes and more likely will make it again. I added more vegetables such as:  chopped up celery, stick of scallions, sliced carrots like matchsticks size,  I chopped up about 8 baby tomatoes, and chopped up parsley and I grated about of ginger and added it to the tablespoon of olive oil and a tsp of butter and cooked up for like 5 mins    
I don't eat pork so I used turkey neckbones and same way I used half of the rubbed mixture and let it marinate for like 1/2 hour while I prepare the beans. To the rub mixture I also added a tsp of allspice and tsp of cinnamon.  And I just do everything the same way. Except when ready to add the beans and the remaining mixture of rub I just added powder coconut milk (1/2 tablespoon) to add a Caribbean taste.   And cook it down for 1/2 hour until beans are tender. Optional:  I added a couple of corn and a handful of greens either arugula or kale or what you like and cook down with beans in half hour time.

I made neck bones for the first time using this recipe and boy it sure was good! The only thing I left out was the nutmeg and sage.

This was good but a little on the bland side. I think if I make this again I will use a smoked meat for more flavor. Ham or maybe smoked turkey would give this more flavor.
