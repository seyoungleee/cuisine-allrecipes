This was fun! I do think the batter could have used more seasoning but that is an easy fix. I used some regular hard boiled quail eggs and some pickled hard boiled quail eggs and even though the pickled ones are not traditional, they sure were good. It almost gave them an "adobe" feel. Thanks for sharing!

I made both this recipe and the large egg version tonkneneng also from this site - and strongly preferred the kwek kwek. The ratio of the textures is much better with smaller eggs. But I will say quail eggs are annoying to peel! I found that it helped to roll them around gently and then get under the membrane - and then use the membrane to gently get the shell off without damaging the egg itself.
