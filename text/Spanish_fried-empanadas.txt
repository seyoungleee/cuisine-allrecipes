This is the real thing! Empanadas Chilenas, I love them.  The only thing I did different was: brushed the empanadas with eggwhites diluted in water and I baked them, 350º for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown.  They were great! Healthy version!

I am not sure what I did wrong. My dough was nothing like the finished product of a lot of the photos on this site.  I do see some photos that look like mine did-which was pale white and very bland.  The filing was bland, too.  I made a double amount and ended up giving them away.  I spent most of the day making them, too.

I agree with Aisha - Dough never browned, wasn't flakey and had no taste.  No comment on the filling, as I used my own recipe.  Really wanted to make the dough myself, as the last time I purchased discos for frying, while they did turn brown, there was no taste and they were not flakey at all.  Guess I'll keep looking!

Oh my gosh!!! This is an awesome recipe!!! It was my first time making fried empanadas and oh my gosh it turned out so wonderful. Love this recipe!!!!

Great recipe,  I didn't make any changes. Perfect.

I make my own filling but use this recipe for the dough.   tastes just like what my mom made when I was a kid!   love it!

I just made the dough it came out great just used some Sazon for color added it in the water and put it in my food processor with dough attachment and let it rest for an hour and I did let it rest for 15 mins when I took it out the fridge and it was great.

Used vegan crumbles

SO GOOD. We did it without raisins because I don’t like them, but we still really enjoyed them

Turned out great but did a little changing on the filling.

I might have done something wrong. It turned out to dry. I think I've made this recipe before and it was not this dry. If I can figure out what I did wrong i might try it again. Thank you for sharing.
