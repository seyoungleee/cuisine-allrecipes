Very unique! The recipe definitely needed more stock and plenty of salt and pepper, but it was a good start.

Absolutely amazing everything was just right and perfect my husband is Iranian and said it was just like his mum used to make him and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe not the first time I’ve followed and made it.

I doubled the lentils, but that is really not necessary, I just like lentils.  So, I added more liquid.  I used homemade turkey stock, water and garlic bouillon. My husband could not stop saying how great this is.  Will make again for sure.  We loved the mint flavor too.

Ash - Reshteh is our favourite winter comfort food It’s a good recipe and turned out very well.
Delicious !

Complex flavor with different variations of sweetness from the caramelized onions and mint to tang from the cilantro. I also added dill in with it to round out the flavor profile.  Very delicious and definitely a meal that stands on its own.

I needed way more broth.  I used about 12 cups and could have used closer to 16-20 to make it soupier.

Well done
We don't make reshte-ash for our new year in lran
But in some family gathering

Excellent recipe! Tastes like my grandma used to make it! Ended up adding more vegetable stock because it wasn’t liquidy enough.
