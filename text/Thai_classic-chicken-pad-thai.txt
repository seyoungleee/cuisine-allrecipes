This is an easy and favorable recipe that has easy prep. and cooking. 

A couple of notes:

1.  If you can only find rice noodles in a 10 ounce pack -- that's fine. 

2.  I did not have any tamarind sauce, but found directions for a substitute: A mixture of vinegar and sugar.  I used a 1:1 mixture.

3.  I also did not use Shrimp paste.  A recommendation was to use a tablespoon of fish sauce.  But, instead of adding it to the mixture, I added it in Step 4 where you would add the shrimp paste.

4.  The recipe does not tell you when to add the spring onions. I added them during Step 5 when you add the egg (which, by the way can be made ahead of time).  You could also add it during Step 4.

All-in-all, a great recipe with really good flavors!

Didn't have tamarind paste so had to substitute.  We used less sugar, and added red pepper flakes, and a little chili powder.  Easy and delicious.
