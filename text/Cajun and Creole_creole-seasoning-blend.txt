I've made this as elementary school teacher gifts for the past two years, and the teachers love it. I omit the cayenne and halve the amount of black pepper, then call it "Kid Friendly Creole Seasoning." I keep a batch of this in my cabinet and use it in many things: steak on the grill, baked chicken, in soups and stews, while cooking ground turkey or ground beef; anytime a little kick is needed. I even used it on my Thanksgiving turkey.  Thanks for the recipe! Even my picky 6-yr old and 8-yr old kids eat this. Note: to reduce the salt, use Kosher salt; gives it a nice texture without as much salty taste.

Just the average spice mix....nothing grand about it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe though.

I'm calling mine Voodoo dust üòÅ

1/2 of basil used as I was short the amount needed

Best seasoning recipe ever for beef rib roast.

This is awesome. Made it just as written. Perfect multipurpose seasoning with right amount of salt (used kosher salt) and heat. Half the recipe fits perfectly into standard size spice jar.

I absolutely love this recipe. I halve the cayenne (the husband doesn't like spicy food) and it is wonderful. I love the idea of gifting this.

This was really easy to make and tasted good on our fish.

Fabulous seasoning blend as the store bought blends contain way too much salt!

To those that found this recipe too salty;I think maybe you used table salt?  I use kosher salt without that problem.
