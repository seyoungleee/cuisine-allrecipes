Made them tonight for supper.  Both myself and my husband said they had no flavor.  Looking for another recipe.

Very delicious! Easy to prepare. I followed the recipe exactly. Light, airy and buttery.The texture is amazing. I have my new holiday recipe for rolls.

I love your Pioneer Woman Plate in the picture!
