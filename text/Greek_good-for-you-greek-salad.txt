This was really great with a few minor tweaks.  I looked over other greek salad recipes on this site and came up with the best dressing.  Instead of 4 tsp. of lemon juice, add 3 and 1 tsp of red wine vinegar.  For the salt and pepper, add 1/4 tsp of each.  Also, add half a green pepper chopped, kalamata olives instead of black and it comes out amazing!

This was tasty. I omitted the olives because we didnt have any on hand. Thought it was good but dont really see how it is much healtheir for you than any other greek salad. I subbed Canola Oil for Olive Oil.

Make this often.We rarely eat salads with lettuce anymore.

I made this salad with apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice. I whipped the oil, vinegar salt, pepper and oregano until creamy and poured it over the salad.  Very good recipe!

Simple and delicious.  What else do you want?

I made this salad last night. It was delicious and filling! It actually kept me from overeating the main course as I had two healthy bowlfuls. This is definitely going to be one of my go-to salads!! Thanks for sharing!!

A wonderful cool refreshing salad.

This is absolutely delicious! I've made this a ton of times. The dressing is perfect, I also use it for a Greek-pasta dish (using a box of rotini pasta, 1.5 times this recipe, add shrimp).

Absolutely delicious! My family loves it!

Hope it last till dinner time!!

Perfect. Simple and easy
