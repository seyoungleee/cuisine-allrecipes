These are fabulous!  I substituted sweet potato instead of yellow potatoes, used yellow onion instead of red onion, tossed in a handful of kale.   These are better than what we can order when dining out, and they are so much healthier!

Good base, but way too salty. I put a little less than the recipe called for and it was still so salty. Recommend using a teaspoon instead if you're making these. Air fry times were pretty good, I did 14 minutes instead of 16.

I followed the recipe but made a combination of cauliflower, grated carrots, a little fresh spinach, and frozen green peas, no onion or potatoes, instead of all cauliflower. Only 1/2 tsp salt.  Fabulous. Served with yogurt and chutney.

These were great! Added a shredded carrot and used a curry paste as a seasoning. Served with yogurt with curry paste and lime as a dipping sauce. It was delicious!

Disappointed.  These tasted good, but the texture was pasty and too salty  (I reduced the salt by 30% so mine tasted OK). They required to be cooked at 375F in my air fryer to get to the right colour in 8 min per side.  They were barely crispy.... will not do again.

Loved the texture and taste of these pakoras! I used sea salt and they were way too salty but I will try again. I recommend a very small dice on the potatoes and cauliflower or they won't cook through. I used a T-fal actifry without the spinning arm and followed the recipe for cook time.
