I found this recipe to be good. I did end up adding more milk (maybe a cup) and a little bit of sugar. But with those two additions it was just like my mother's recipe from Russia.

I haven't tried it but looks like a good recipe for oladyii. NOT blini. Blini are thin crepe-like pancakes with an almost liquid batter. Oladyii are more similar to American pancakes, small and thick. I know most foreigners don´t mind whether it's one Russian word or another, but this mistake is noticeable right away to a Russian.

Simple and delicious. This has become my go-to blini recipe!

I made this last Sunday and it was perfectly  delicious everybody(guest) loves it.  must try it guys☺️😋😋

I like the simplicity and you really can impress your guests.   If you try to buy 20 mini blini pancakes online or at a specialty store you can be looking at paying between $20 and $40 and this recipe is no more than four dollars in ingredients.

very good

My wife and I made these and were very pleased with the results.  Using buckwheat flour gave a slight nutty flavor and was authentic.  I have been to a reception where instead of smoked salmon or caviar, thinly sliced rare roast beef with a horseradish cream was equally delicious.

These turned out perfectly, nice and thin and a little chewy. The ONLY thing I’m going to do differently next time is less than a tablespoon of batter per blini - these were a little larger than the perfect canapé mouthful I was looking for, coming out at about 2 1/2” to 3” across. I served as part of a fancy brunch topped with creme fraiche, caviar, smoked salmon, dill.

Easy to make and so delicious

Perfect fast recipe.
