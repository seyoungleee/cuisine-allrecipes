These turned out really perfect for me, followed the recipe to the letter except  scaled to 2 servings. I served with shredded cabbage (ie, bagged coleslaw mix). Really nice light summer lunch.

I followed the directions as written, including the more exotic ingredients.  I was excited about making these but found them disappointingly dry. I didn't keep the leftover meatballs - just tossed them. I think I'll try a new recipe next time. I also found the meatballs lacked the intensity of flavor that I would have preferred.

Absolutely delicious!  I made them as written.  They were tender, and the dipping sauce put them over the top.  Highly recommended...

You need to be careful not to overcook - even though they look very light in colour, transfer them to broil after the recommended time.

Delicious!  I didn't make the dipping sauce and served it over jasmine rice.  However, the meatballs were tender and, with the beautiful array of flavors,  I didn't feel like a sauce was even needed.  I will make this dish again!

Absolutely Delicious! I substituted some of the harder to get ingredients such as fish sauce and shallots for ones I had around the house (soy sauce and onion) but this dish still turned out wonderfully.
