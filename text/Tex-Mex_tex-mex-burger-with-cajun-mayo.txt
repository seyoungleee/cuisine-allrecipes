Great Burger!  Whipped up cajun seasoning (from a cookbook recipe) by using 2 parts black pepper, 1 part ground cayenne, 1 part cumin, 1 part nutmeg and a dash of salt.  Used yellow onion, not white and I think the beef was just round or 'hamburger'.  Didn't have pepperjack slices, so used provolone.  The mayo made a great topper.  One of the best burgers we've ever had.

These burgers had a nice spicy kick but not a lot of flavour. I think we just prefer a burger with grilled onions, bacon & BBQ sauce.

Recipe was great, but there is a problem with the amount on the cajun seasoning. The ingredients say the same amount for both the sauce & for the burger a tablespoon. Yet in the directions it has tsp for the sauce. I'm assuming it is the same amount for sauce and to use in the burgers but the direction for sauce someone goofed and put tsp instead of tablespoon. This should be checked into & corrected. Again will make the burgers/sauce again but hate the new format for the recipes and all the flaws in trying to print an adjusted recipe.

We enjoyed this burger recipe. Will definitely be making this again!

soooo gooooood. dont need that much mayo, though. i’d make half as much next time.

Thought it turned out quite good.

I like the sauce, but I'd prefer a more traditional burger recipe. It has a nice tang but the whole ingredients will be prepared next time on top of the burger instead of in it.

The burgers were great. My wife loved them. Just enough spice but not too much.

pretty tasty

Pretty happy with this burger. I needed to add more cajun seasoning to both the burger and the mayo. "Cajun Seasoning" can vary quite a bit recipe to recipe or brand to brand so that is really to taste. Love the Worcestershire sauce in the meat, but the chopped onion and jalapeños get lost. Next time I'll just use them as toppings. 07/11/17

Leave the Ketchup off this burger and enjoy the fabulous Cajun Mayo. This is one delishious  burger. Loved these!
