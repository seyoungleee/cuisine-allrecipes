Delicious hearty bread.  Easy.. kneaded this in my Kitchen Aid. Smells wonderful baking. Great with butter and used in sandwiches

Wonderful bread,great aroma, I added a bit more orange üçä and the 2nd rise time cut in half. I'm going to make it again in a bit hotter oven, 375¬∞. Also doubled the recipe for two loaves!!

It never says when to add the spices in.

Wonderful spicy aroma.  I made this twice and love it with any sandwich fixins.  It is a very filling bread.  2 slices is almost too much for a luncheon sandwich.  Follow recipe as is.  I prepped mine in  a Ninja food processer.

Great recipe. Tasty and great texture and form.
