Very tasty!

Spicy Korean Fried Chicken with Gochujang Sauce...My 2 favorite things on this earth. I wonder if there's a way to combine them with dumplings? Hmmm yummmmm

I made this for Super Bowl, and it was not a crowd pleaser, unfortunately. It was way too sweet for our taste. The gochujang flavor was masked and overpowered by all the sweetness.

I had to scale this recipe down a bit but the chicken was good. I used a tbsp of each of the sauce ingredients, adding more Worcester’s to it since I preferred a less sweet sauce. I also fried twice at 350 and 375 degrees respectively. The temps as stated are a little low to be frying but probably fine if you’re at a higher altitude. The only other things I did different was season the chicken as I normally would.

I've only made it once so far and I am new to cooking but this was the best fried chicken I have ever made, it was so good! I think I messed up and took the sauce off heat too early though because the spice was lost in the sweetness of the sugar and soy. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing!

A bit too sweet for my taste. I think next time I’ll cut back on the honey. It has a very clear honey taste into it. Probably use half or even a fourth of what was called for. Also only 4 minutes at 325 then 350 wasn’t enough time for frying chicken. Had to crank it up to 375 for about 6-8 minutes total.

It’s amazing it just melts in my mouth I made sure not to make it too spicy for everyone to enjoy
