Sooooo good and easy to make! When served, I put down a bed of spinach, then topped with cherry tomatoes and a little extra salsa and sour cream just to make a "taco" salad more interesting and different. However, I did follow the recipe until that point. Thank you for the great recipe!

Easy toMake, delicious and filling. I layered my pan with flour tortillas, and the a few tortilla chips.

This recipe is legit! Thank you for sharing ??????????!
