I think it's a great starter recipe! I did not have any broccoli and I used a different cut of meat. Since the last reviewer said it needed a little something I added a tsp of ginger and a bit of salt and pepper to the meat in the beginning. Then I replaced the broccoli with green bell peppers. It was a hit! Even the baby loved it :)

It was O.K. but I ended up adding lots of salt and pepper as well as teriyaki sauce because there wasn't very much taste to it. Also I added other vegetables like zucchini, water chestnuts and more onions. Overall very easy!

Added msg, really good and easy to make

Easy and delicious!

I already make something very similar, but I always add a shake or 2 of Chinese 5 spice and Sesame oil and I use Olive oil when stir frying!

Delicious! I definitely would heat the minced garlic and half of the onion in the pan before adding the beef, gives a great flavor. Adding a dash of Sesame Oil also helps to enhance the dish :)

Go with a green bell pepper. Throw the red into your mouth.The red one is too sweet for me.

Very easy to make! Substituted yellow squash for carrots. May also work over a bed of sushi rice, which I am going to try next time!

So easy, pretty low cost.

So easy and simple ant the taste was amazing ðŸ¤©.

Bland will not be using this recipe again.
