Great flavor, will make again, BUT I will not pour sauce over the tofu, it gets soggy. It would be better to dip as I go.

Was tasty, just why did we make so much sauce? 2 cups water is too much for one package of tofu. That's all. Make half sauce and perfect.

Make sure the oil isn't too hot! Also be sure to drain the tofu into a bowl or sink or something.

All in all, a good recipe :) It was quite tasty.
