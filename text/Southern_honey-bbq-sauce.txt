We were a little short on honey and we used cumin instead of the liquid smoke. But this sauce turned our wings into the best we've ever had. Great recipe!

Made it exactly as described and used it to make BBQ chicken thighs for my kids. It’s extremely good. I had to buy more chicken so I could make the same thing again the next day.

I wanted a good recipe for Honey BBQ Sauce and this was the first one that I tried. No need to look any further. This is a great sauce and exactly what I was looking for. I will be making this many more times.

This was easy to make and is sweet with a little kick. I doubled  the recipe except for the cayenne pepper as the cayenne I have is a bit hotter than most. You can adjust the spiciness by how much cayenne you use.

Unfortunately I ran out of onionpowder so used extra garlic powder.  Tastes awesome. This recipe fits great in an HP bottle and keeps for a long time in the fridge.

I made this sauce to put on a meatloaf.  Since it is a ketchup-based sauce it worked perfectly for my meal because I prefer a ketchup-heavy topping for my meatloaf.

OMFG. I made this sauce expecting it to be tasty, but this is downright delicious. Whoever came up with this recipe needs a Michelin Star. Best homemade sauce I’ve ever had.  Excuse my crappy picture, this sauce is fantastic though.

So good with vegetarian chicken/Seitan!

My husband love this Barbeque sauce .

Added a shot of whiskey and it was money on chicken.
