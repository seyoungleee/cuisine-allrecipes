I really liked this and wouldn't change a thing next time. I did use can baby corn because that is all I have available here.

Excellent  side dish. Used canned baby corn and button shroooms. Quick and delicious!

I added only soya sauce instead of all. Loved it very much... Also added some salt to taste and some herbs.. Its really delicious. Will make it again

Easy and delicious.

I doubled the Sauce, and added pak choi. Served it with tempura breaded fish and rice...

sooo good, i have made it numerous times

Stir-Fried Mushrooms with Baby Corn Haiku: "This blew us away! And I had to use canned corn. Wish I could find fresh!" I have every intention of making this again (possible w/ the addition of chicken, tofu or shrimp to make it more of an entree) as it was easy and delicious, and I'll be sure to track down fresh baby corn, or at the very least use a more interesting mushroom than the baby bellas that I got on sale. The only other change was sprinkling w/ crushed red pepper flakes. We were very surprised at how wonderful this turned out to be!

Good recipe

Right away I knew I wanted to make these because they feature my husband's favorite: baby corn. This recipe is so easy, and tastes like you just got it at the corner mom & pop Chinese joint. So quick, easy and economical, thanks for sharing, we will make this again!

Added carrots as well.  Made a nice side dish.  The cilantro really gave it a nice flavor.
