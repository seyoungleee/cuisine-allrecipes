This was very easy and came out great! I marinated the lamb overnight.  I also used little grape tomatoes and alternated lamb and tomato on the skewer.  Served with rice and a salad. My boyfriend loved it and I will definitely make it again.

I used one onion and chopped instead of grated because I was lazy. Marinated cut up chicken for two hours because that's all the time I had.  Thought it tasted great.  Served with grilled asparagua and basmati rice

I did it under the broiler since it is 10 degrees outside. I also started by broiling  mushrooms then added the lamb and then the tomatoes on a foil lined baking sheet. It came out beautifully. The juices were a great bonus.

The marinade is delicious with grilled chicken breasts.
