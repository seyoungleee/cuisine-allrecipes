These came out a bit runny to our liking so next time I will do less fluids other than that they came out great.  To bad my guys did not care for them.  Oh well, more for me.  Thanks for the recipe.

My grandkids absolutely loved this recipe. Will be making this again soon!

It was so good and it was super easy to make as a college student with a waffle maker! I added cinnamon sugar in and it was amazing

This recipe is delicious! 10/10 I do recommend using sweet chocolate chips to give it more flavor!

I have a Salton Belgium waffle maker that makes 2 waffles at a time so I used 1/3 c batter on each side and it took about 4 minutes. Quick and easy recipe.
