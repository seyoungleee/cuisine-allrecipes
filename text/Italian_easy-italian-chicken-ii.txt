This is the easiest and most delicious chicken recipe!!! I make it for my roommates at least once a week, it is one of their favorites!!  Before marinating the chicken I make sure to poke holes in it with a fork to let the marinate soak in, as another reviewer suggested.  I use a zesty Italian dressing and usually throw it together before leaving for work, 9 hours later it has a great flavor and makes a quick meal.  To give it an extra kick, before cooking I usually take a few pieces and dip each side in a bowl of parmasean cheese.  I'm not a fan of the extra cheesy taste but everyone else loves it that way!!  Cook this with the Oven Roasted Potatoes recipe from this site and you have an easy and delicious meal that people will love!!

I have never made italian chicken like this before. I always bake my chicken while it is still in the marinade, it makes it MUCH more juicy and flavorful..and I usually spoon some of the marinade over the chicken when I serve it. The family loves it that way. Baking it without the marinade made it very dry. You should definitely bake it with the marinade!!!

It is delicious! I paired it with mashed potatoes and asparagus

Love it

I do this, but I cook in crockpot. So juicy and tender

Because it gets unbearable hot here in Alabama, I make this in the crockpot! My family loves it ❤️

We added some parm and mozz at the very end. AWESOME!!

This has to be one of the easiest dishes with an excellent effort-to-outcome ratio. When I first heard about a similar recipe, I was skeptical. But, you can take pretty much any bottled salad dressing and do this (probably not creamy ones, like 1000 island...). I've done it with Greek, Catalina, and many others.

YUM,YUM!!

My mom did this since I was a child, it is delicious! It pairs well with spaghetti. Also good with bone in chicken and on the grill it is awesome!

Delicious and so easy.
