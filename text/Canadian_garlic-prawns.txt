I actually marinated the prawns, then sauteed them in butter and garlic.  Afterwards, I reduced the marinade and put on angel hair pasta.  It was excellent.

We really enjoyed these I only had medium size shrimp. Sauteed in orange flavored olive oil and minced garlic served over angel hair pasta. Yum!!!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

it was great and flavorfull!

It was excellant

Wife really liked the marinade and the reduction was subtle, but great, on pasta. Accidentally added two tablespoons of basil and turned out fine.

I have made MANY recipes off this site and many of them have been great but this is the  first time one has been so good that I actually wrote a review.  YUMMMMMMY! I had 35 Jumbo shrimp and no lemons or oranges so I doubled everything in the marinade and used half a cup of lemon juice and half a cup of orange juice. Only had to grill 2 minutes each side. These were fantastic mouthgasmic!  Cannot wait to have them again!!

The only change I made was I used honey mustard because that is what I had. Great balance of flavors. Super easy!! This one goes in the favorites for sure!!

I didn't have any dijon mustard, so I added a teaspoon of horseradish to the recipe.  I also added 2Tbs of melted butter to the marinade.  It was great!

The taste of the shrimp was great. I saut√©ed them in butter. Added extra clove of garlic. Lots of flavour. Didn't like the marinade for the sauce though. we had pesto over pasta with our prawns, will make them again on the grill in the summer.

Good overall, but I will try to use more spice next time!
