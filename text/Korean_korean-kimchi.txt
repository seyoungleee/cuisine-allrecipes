Good recipe. I did not add MSG and put dried kimchi pepper instead of the red pepper flakes and added some minced ginger as well.

Very good recipe for using napa.   Best of course is Korean cabbage - bechu.   Can be had in a Korean market like HMART.    Also there are over 2000 kimchi recipes and in fact there is a Kimchi Cultural Center in Seoul run by nuns.  There is also two major types of kimchi - summer (fresh) and winter (sour).

This was a first for my family and we were not quite sure what to expect.  Turns out we really enjoyed it.  I skipped the MSG and added more of the crushed red pepper a day into the process.  I would try this again upping the spice at the beginning.

We love kimchi and I was excited to give this one a try. It turned out great! I too left out the MSG. It seems to get better the longer it sits.

I am making another batch today. VERY yummy. I did not add the MSG.
