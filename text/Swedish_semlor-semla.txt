I added a tad of whole wheat flour to my batch, and they came out beautifully! The only suggestion I would make is to wait to dust the semlor with powdered sugar until RIGHT BEFORE you serve them. I dusted mine, stuck them in the fridge for a few hours, and the sugar disappeared as condensation from being chilled appeared. I should know better, but they just looked so cute!

I wanted to like this recipe.  I lived in Sweden for a few years and love semlor, but this isn't how I remember them.  I don't know how much of that was my own fault.
The bun tasted right, but was too dense and chewy.
The filling was too diluted by the bread.  The mandel massa flavor was lost.  I added almond extract and sugar to try to restore some of the flavor, but it still tasted too much like soggy bread.
I will compare this with other semlor recipes and try again with some tweaks.  It didn't quite scratch my semlor itch.

I have never had traditional semla, so I can't speak on that aspect of the recipe--but I thought these buns were good! I made a half batch, and formed the dough into 16 small-ish buns. I was very happy with how they came out. I do agree with the reviewer who said that they felt the almond filling tasted "watered down." For my own tastes, I would like a stronger almond flavor in the filling--so maybe adding more marzipan (or almond paste), alongside some extra almond extract and maybe even some toasted almonds. These buns would also be delicious with some jam or fresh fruit. Overall, these were a really fun baking experiment; and I would make them again. Thanks so much for your recipe!

I make this receipe every year for Easter now.  My family loves them.  I suggest making the buns small.  Excellent though, the Swedes make them for Easter I think, that is where I first had them.

A very good recipe. I made them for my dad as a surprise (he had them all the time as a kid), I was able to use almond paste instead of marzipan (he agreed with a previous poster about it being more authentic), when he bit into it he said "It's a semla!" (I guess he didn't have much faith,) it turned out perfect. WARNING: Only eat one at a time, they are pretty filling.

Good and easier to make than you would expect.  The marzipan is drowned out by the whipping cream, so I recommend you take this into account when deciding on the ratio of marzipan mix to whipping cream when filling the buns.

My grandmother, whose Swedish, loved them.  I certainly did too and it was a great experience discovering a part of the Swedish culture, since I do have that ancestry.  The bread itself is amazing and I might make it plain and eat it the way they do in Sweden, with warmed milk in a bowl.  These Semlor are definitely a keeper in my book.  I dashed mine with both powdered sugar and some cinnamon.

Thank you! I made this with my half Swedish boyfriend who remembered his grandmother making these. Easy to follow recipe - adjusting the marzipan mix to taste so lots of marzipan (according to the consultant) grating it first helped followed by electric mixer. We thoroughly enjoyed them:)

These were delicious! I'll be making them again, that's for sure!

Giving this recipe only 4 and not 5 stars due to the fact that authentic 'semlas' have almond paste instead of marizpan in the middle..... Yummy!
