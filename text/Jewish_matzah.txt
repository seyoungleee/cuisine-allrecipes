this was very yummy I made it for using with hummus and it was very good...will make again

I greatly appreciated the thorough instructions on this recipe.  However, these crackers desperately need oil IN the dough, not just an "anointing" after baking. Following the directions exactly as written produced a kettle cooked potato chip like consistency instead of the familiar crisp-flaky matzo.  After checking several Kosher recipes online, I'll be making these with the oil mixed into the flour in the future.

1/2 teaspoon salt is too much...reduce it and nice recipe

I am a pastry arts instructor, and I used this recipe as a lesson in speed and accuracy. One of my students came very close to the 18 minute limit, but we will try again. The matzah was very good.

Made them for seder Friday night and everyone loved them!

Easy, they are in the oven now. SoHang on let's see.First time, I hope this is it!! Looks fabulous

Great recipe! I love the background on the making of the matzah! Delicious!

Thank you for this!  SO much better than the store bought ones we usually get.

Very good. I'll use to to make Matzah Brei.

WONDERFUL!!!

I've been making it every day this week. It's wonderful! If you just follow the instructions, you get better and better at it. They taste so good! Where I am we can't get packaged matzah, and I've become glad that that's the case! These taste so much better! and they're kosher for Pesach!
