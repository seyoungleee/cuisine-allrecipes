I served this with yellow saffron spanish rice and chutney and it was amazing.  I live with a south african and she says it was perfect!

1.14.21 Well, this doesn’t have much eye appeal, but its flavor is very interesting and very different.  Recipe said to bake for 30 minutes, but at 15 minutes, it had dried out and was starting to burn, so I took it out.  I then added the egg-milk mixture and then back in the oven.  And after another 20 minutes, it was drying out again.  So bottom line, next time, I’ll probably add a little water to the ground  beef mixture before it heads into the oven, cook for 12-15 minutes, then add the egg mixture, then back in the oven, and start checking for doneness at 15 minutes.  We really enjoyed the flavor, but the cooking time needs to be cut back, at least for us, in order to have a moist consistency/texture.  Never had bootie before, so I have no comparison if this recipe measures up, but we liked it, and I know it’ll be even better with a little tweaking on time only, seasoning was spot on for us.

I'm no expert cook but I'm South African ! Wonderful dish, I substituted the raisins ( eeuuww ! ) for canned sliced peaches & used the sweet juices instead of adding sugar. I like the adding of vinegar, gives it a nice sour to balance the sweet. Also I used 3 eggs & more milk for the topping. It is delicious !!
