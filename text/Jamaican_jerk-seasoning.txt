I thought this was really good.  Low on the heat scale but still pretty good. Traditionally, jerk seasoning has cinnamon and sometimes nutmeg in it.  I like the flavor of jerk but not w/the cinnamon/nutmeg thing. I left out the cinnamon on this one. If you think this is "dry", this is basically a "dry rub" for your meat. If you want something different you need to try a jerk paste.  Toss a medium onion in a processor and then add the rest of the ingredients. Throw in some habenero or jalapeno to! :)

A good taste, with enough spice to be interesting.

A quick and easy way to make your own jerk seasoning. Sure, there are hundreds of variations on jerk seasoning and this is a great basic blend.  I used it on grilled chicken and it was super tasty, with a nice hint of heat. I might add a bit more salt next time.

My children loved the chicken I made with this seasoning .

Was very nice.

Recipes like this come in a thousand varieties.  If this isn't exactly what you want, feel free to change it.

My family loved it as is.

very good, very hot.

Worked great, I used it for pork tenderloin.  I didn't have allspice but had all the ingredients for it.  Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe itself tastes fine. It's not a real Jamaican jerk seasoning for a couple of reasons: there is no scotch bonnet/habanero pepper. Cayenne pepper is not the same and you do not get the classic citrus-like undertone of the Scotchie pepper. Also, you need to add paprika and either fresh key lime juice or key lime zest. Of course, no recipe will yield true Jamaican flavor without the classic wood smoke of using pimento wood charcoal as the grill fuel.

I don't really have any other jerk seasonings to compare to, but I thought this one was pretty tasty.

Easy to make and pretty tasty. I think I will make some adjustments next time to fit my preferences but overall I would recommend for a simple jerk mix.

Perfect
