This is a good and tasty fish. In my opinion, the sauce was a bit vinegary, so next time I`ll use less vinegar. Habanero pepper is unavailable here, so I used jalapeno pepper. I sauted the vegetables a little more than the recipe says. Very good, easy to make and unexpensive dish, will make often, thanks.

The dish is perfect

love it.. BUT a dash of white vinegar , not too much. My second attempt was perfect with a dash . happy though.

Delish!!!!

This recipe is easy and full of flavor.  The pickled vegetables really make this dish! I did add some celery to the recipes. I will make this again real soon.

Delicious and simple to make. Thank your grandmother for teaching you this.

I would substitute white wine for vinegar or reduce vinegar.

I liked it, but it uses more vinegar than what's needed.

OMG this fish is so stinking good it doesn’t make sense! That relish is amazing!!! Don’t change a thing. Try and find bonnet peppers if possible :) Worth it but sub a habanero if it can’t be found. So good!

Delicious. Used the pickle with different kinds of fish in addition to the snapper.
