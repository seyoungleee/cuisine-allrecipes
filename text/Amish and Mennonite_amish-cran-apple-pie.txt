Love the idea of cran-apple pie!! I made a pie using the filling from this recipe with a different crust. The frozen cranberries held up completely (didn't fall/bust/become juicy/jammy), remained super tart and didn't blend with the apple flavor. Needed more sugar (and I'm usually one who tries to cut sugar after trying a recipe), more lemon, and a higher apple:cran ratio. If making this again, I would cook down the cranberries first using citrus juice, sugar, water, cinnamon, and citrus zest before adding to filling. I did not rate based on crust bc I didn't use the recipe's crust.
