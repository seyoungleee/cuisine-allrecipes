I kicked it up a notch by adding bonnet scotch.  I blended that with the tomatoes, onions, pepper in my vitamix first then continued with the receipe!

In the west indies it's also called "Bake and Saltfish."  I usually make the saltfish very much like you did, but I add a few cloves of minced garlic.  In NYC I ran across a deli that put shredded cabbage and carrots in the mixture; sounds kinda weird but it was fantasic!  I've made it at home just the same.  Kids and hubby loved it, and it helped stretch the saltfish, that is quite expensive in my area.

Delicious! I made some changes, I didn't use tomatoes but I added red and green peppers, parsley, white onions, garlic, all porpose seasoning, paprika and hot Chille.It's similar to some pastries we made in Portugal and called pataniscas de bacalhau.

Delish however I definitely put fresh Thyme and omitted the tomatoes.  ALSO I put some red bell peppers and a hot Jamaican pepper (scotch bonnet is too strong for me lol).  Additionally I let batter sit about 10 minutes before cooking to let the baking powder do it’s thing.

Instead of tomatoes i added red sweet peppers (jalapeños). I also added some escallion and scotch bonnet peppers.

Delicious!
I made the original recipe but will try the scotch bonnet version next time. Soaking the salt fish overnight is a must to avoid excessive salt

This recipe is great with a salad.  Add hot peppers for a more spicy flavor.  Fritters came out light and airy.

The batter was too thick. Had to add more than the 1/2 cup water.

I nailed it. My son said they were light and decadent. My husband is from Jamaica and he said it felt like he was home. Thank you.

I will definitely make it again. I added some other seasonings and was overall pleased.

I added some red pepper and Callaloo and it was yummy. Will definitely make again
