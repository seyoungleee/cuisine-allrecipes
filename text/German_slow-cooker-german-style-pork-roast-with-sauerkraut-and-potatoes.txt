I have been making this the exact same way for years and always comes out great. Point is to make sure that the pork stays in the "juice." I always put my roast in frozen so maybe that makes the extra liquid needed to keep the pork moist. My family loves this.  Sometimes we even add potatoes to the slow cooker.

Cooked this on low for 8 hrs. (minimum time stated)and the pork was dry and overcooked - when I tried to slice it, it shredded into threads and fell apart. The pork was virtually flavorless.  I thought about making it again with more seasonings for flavor and reducing the cooking time, but 8 hrs. seemed absolutely perfect for the potatoes - they were not mushy/overcooked so reducing the cooking time might cause undercooked potatoes.

Perfect balance.  My wife added some chicken broth, and I placed the potatoes at the bottom.  Everyone loved it including my Asian wife.

Used a country spare rib style roast, added carrots and topped it off with browned knockwurst at the final 2 hour point.  Didnt have carraway seeds, it was quite nice!

Made this for my father in-law who is German and we all loved it! Super easy to make.

Great Recipe

Very simple and delicious.  I follow the recipe with the exception of adding 1 or 2 peeled, cored and sliced Granny Smith apples.

This recipe was DELICIOUS! I used a 3.5lb bone-in center cut pork loin roast and cooked it for the full 8 hours. The meat turned out succulent and juicy and the potatoes were cooked to perfection.  Definitely on my list of favorites!

This was the driest pork roast I have ever made. I will never make this again.

I used pork spareribs .

I made this yesterday. I added about a dozen small red potatoes in lieu of baked potatoes. Because of work, I left it on low for 10 1/2 hours. It was still FANTASTIC! Will make again!
