This was very tasty!  Go buy a jar of kalamata olives instead, add a splash of red wine vinegar and some garlic and it's even better!

The way the salad was presented allowed one to really appreciate the vegetable flavors. I was on a quest to find the "restaurant style" Greek salad. I added more oregano (doubled the dressing portions) used mediterranian feta, no olives, and red wine vinegar. Now the red wine vinegar gave it the missing zip in my opinion. This may change the healthiness but if I live on this stuff, I am sure it will be great eating vegees regularly! Pita bread is a must w/my Greek salads too! (my next quest~to find a lowfat recipe!)  Thank you!

The salad was delicious!

Amazing! I would keep eating this every day!

Absolutely delicious ðŸ˜‹ the best salad I've had in a very long time

Light and refreshing. The fresh dressing makes the veggie taste pop. Yum!

I love the salad and think you can add/subtract veggies you want to but then it wouldn't be an official Greek salad. I do wish the dressing had a bit more zip.

Omitted green pepper due to allergies and added more cucumber.Doubled the recipe, ate it without the lettuce and it was amazing!Will definitely make this again!

It is great. Quick and lots of great vegies.

Great salad, can also be called Balkan salad or shepherds salad.  I served tomatoes on the side (just me) and substitute banana peppers for olives but would have added olives too if I had them.  Good to invest in quality feta.

Very good
