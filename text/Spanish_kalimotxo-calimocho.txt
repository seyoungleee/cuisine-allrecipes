I was not sure about red wine and dark cola, but I tried it and it was refreshing, delicious, and really easy. Thanks!

Been drinking this for years. We call it a "Cola Red". Lots of people turn their noses up to the idea of this, but it really is just a red wine version of a white wine sprtizer.  A great way to drink red wine on a warm summer night. Not as sweet as a sangria. And with diet soda it comes out to be a fairly low-cal drink. Adjust the ratio to your personal preference. I like more red than cola

Living in Basque Country, Nevada, I've had my share of these at bars. Nice to be able to prepare one at home! Thanks!

Not good unless you add a lot more coke.

As a teenager, this is what my cousin made for us the first time I ever drank. It went down just fine...

I saw this drink on The Chive app. It didnt have a recipe attached so where else would one go to get a trustworthy recipe. I left the garnish off. Good drink. Will make again after I finish this one. Lol

I would prefer about 3/4 wine and the remainder coke with a lemon slice.

This was pretty good. I used sangiovese and diet cola. I also added the lemon to the drink and it seemed to help blend the flavors together.

The Basque do it best.  When making this, pay special attention to the fiz.  You want a light purple fiz, which to me, is more wine, less cola!  And get the cheapest bottle!  My favorite 5 o'clock cocktail.
