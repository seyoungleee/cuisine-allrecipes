I did this, but I changed and added some things!
Instead of rice vinegar I used Balsamic vinegar and mixed in sugar and salt.
Than instead of mayonnaise, I used cream cheese (which is what most California Sushi Rolls use) cut into cubes placed on top of the Nori sheets along side the crab and avocado. I do not use the red caviar, cucumber, or the drained pickled ginger.
My version come out really good! The rice kinda of had a dark tint to it because of the sauce.

The mayonnaise is used on your fingers so nothing sticks to it. Great job in the useless description of how to make this folks. You have people mixing it in as per the first person that reviewed this recipe. Try harder next time...

good Califnia roll

As an Asian, I do equal parts water as rice.

This is so delicious

Husband says it tastes like the real thing. I omitted the mayonnaise and salt otherwise followed the recipe.  We made 5 rolls/40 pieces. Will make again.

I added a tsp of sesame oil to the rice.
Cook a bit longer if rice is still damp.

As expected.....video helped.

Me and my daughter made california rolls and we added additional ingredients.  Like Saracha mayo,eel sauce, and French fried onions.  This came out just like the dragon rolls that we buy at the store, except that we added a little more eel sauce.

easy with all different variations, butterflied shrimp, fresh salmon... yum!

this is fantastic made it just as instructed wouldn't change a thing except for maybe adding cream cheese with the crab instead it was truly wonderful! the caviar was expensive but worth it!!
