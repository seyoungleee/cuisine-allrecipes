SO GOOD!! My grocery store didn't have the right sausage so I substituted with smoked sausage. I used jasmine rice bc that's what I always use for white and I went with pinto beans. Awesome! Thanks Cathy!

USED DEER SAUSAGE INSTEAD OF PORTUGUESE AND ADDED CHICKEN FOR THOSE THAT DIDN'T LIKE THE SAUSAGE. CAME OUT OK BUT SOMETHING MISSING FROM THE FLAVOR I REMEMBER AS A CHILD.

Great, easy, quick recipe! Are used cannellini beans which are nice and tender. Very flavorful and I added additional Cholula sauce at the table because I like things hot! I will definitely make this again.

Thanks for saving dinner! I had no plan, but I found all the ingredients and followed the recipe exactly, and pretty soon all five kids were happily eating a great meal! I had to use kielbasa sausage, but it was great.

This recipe was fantastic!  I made it according to the directions as far as the ingredients were concerned. I did add a touch of paprika and some salt, but thatâ€™s it. I also cooked the sauce and rice separately pouring the linguica sauce over the rice. My family loved it, and it was super easy to make. I will definitely make it again!

Next time, I'll cook the rice separately and add it last.  It turned out mushy when added from the beginning.
