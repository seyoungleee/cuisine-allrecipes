This has a wonderful flavor!!  It does need more vegatables because it's all meat.  I added sugar snap peas, water chesnuts, and carrots.

The concept is good, but I really had to alter the recipe a lot to make it more flavorful. I added some honey teriyake sauce, Thai garlic-pepper sauce, and cornstarch mixed with some water to thicken the sauce.

Delightful quick and easy meal.  I added broccoli, mushroom, red onion and garlic and served it over top brown rice. I did omit the extra salt. I did double the amount of soy sauce and vinegar and mixed that with 1/4 cup of chicken broth to which I added 1 tsp of cornstarch to thicken it up into a sauce.  Next time I'll add red pepper flakes to give it a kick.  I will definitely make this again!

Really yummy! I added a pack of stir fry veggies towards the end and was more generous with the sesame oil (because my husband is crazy for it). Simple and quick, my kind of dinner.

Quick and easy to make . Dish needed more flavor so we added fire oil, red peppers, more garlic, red wine and more ginger. Served with brown rice. It all went!

I added squash to and fresh mushrooms and made my own stir fry sauce. I will make again

very easy and good for a beginner

Very Good !!!!

Will definitely make again.  Have everything ready to go because it cooks up quick.  Very good taste!

This was tasty and relatively easy.

I prepared the recipe as written but found that I wanted more liquid in it.  I will review the feedback from others to see if there are any suggestions.  Otherwise, very good for flavor
