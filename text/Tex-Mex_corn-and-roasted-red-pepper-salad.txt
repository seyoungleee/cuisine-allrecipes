I've never had pomegranate-infused red wine vinegar, and wasn't about to buy it for one recipe (done that type thing tooooo many times). I did have some pomegranate juice in the fridge which I added to red wine vinegar which I think was fine.  IMO unless you're a pomegranate-infused red wine vinegar lover, I think you'll be happy just with a good-quality red wine vinegar.  We had this salad (which I served chilled) with some grilled jalapeño chicken sausages, and really enjoyed it.  And I agree with the recipe author, it would be a good addition to a Mexican meal.  Good balance of sweet, sour and spicy.

Several things made me suspicious about this recipe.  First, it only had one review. Second, I was leery of something calling itself a salad  - but you have to boil it for 25 minutes in 1½ cup of vinegar and, lastly...why would I want to boil the delicate flavor of roasted red peppers in vinegar and hot spices for 25 minutes?  So I proceeded with low expectations.  Bottom line is - this is ok, and some might like it.   Better name for this recipe would be 'Corn with a Kick.'  Not my taste.
