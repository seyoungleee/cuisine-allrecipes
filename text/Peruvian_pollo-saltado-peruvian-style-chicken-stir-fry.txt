I’ve had saltado many times but this is the first time I’ve made it at home.  I’m sorry to say but I feel something was missing.  That being said it is very flavorful but as a saltado it’s lacking. At the end I had to add lime juice to brighten it up.  I even added a 1/2 tsp more  vinegar to the marinade because I LOVE that saltado tang.  The recipe doesn’t talk about the tomatoes so I added them when I put the other veggies in.  I can’t say I’ll make this one again.
