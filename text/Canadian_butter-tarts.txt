This is a very good recipe and I have been using it for a while. The only thing I changed was to add some vanilla. I think the vanilla gives it a fuller flavour. These are a favorite in my house!

I found these tarts very "dry"- I guess I like mine with a little less raisins/nuts and more butter and sugar mixture.  I also had to bake them for 35-40 min at 325 and were not at all overdone.

I have been making this recipe for years. Always a big hit at bake sales. I sometimes omit the nuts, but the only thing I change is adding a bit of vanilla. There are many variations for Butter Tarts. This is my fave & yes I'm Canadian.

Delicious and easy to make! Traditional taste but can be altered easily by substituting the nuts or raisins.

These were a hit at my house I made mine with walnuts and pecans instead of rasins I did have to add about 10 to 20 minutes to the cook time to ensure the shells were cooked but they were delicious

Lovely recipe, i used croissant pastry instead of tart shells, add salt n vanilla , use less raisin n replace by pecans. My husband love it. Can't help himself having 2 tarts a day.

Yummy!!!

Added teaspoon of vanilla

I love how easy this recipe is but I was a bit disappointed in the taste. Maybe I went wrong somewhere although I'm sure I followed the recipe to the T. I didn't find them very sweet at all (maybe just my sweet tooth?!) and had to bake them longer than indicated on the recipe.  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla as others recommended but I feel like something is still missing.

My husband said these are the best butter tarts he has ever had. They remind me of my Grandma's and hers were fantastic!

I've been making this particular recipe every year for the last 10 years for my family. One year I didn't make enough and I didn't hear the end of it until the next year when I doubled up! It is now a tradition in my family with my kids.
