Different from other yogurt dips I have made...the cream cheese really makes it smooth and delectable...Old and young loved it..

i have nothing to compare it to, but everyone who tired it loved it.

Wow and wow!  I made this over the weekend and simply loved it!  I make my own yogurt cheese quite often and enjoy coming across new ways to use it.  I know I will be making it again and often.  I didn’t bother with the cream cheese, just didn’t feel it was a necessary ingredient.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good.  Followed recipe as written and this turned out nicely.  Thanks

My Turkish friend makes it with Olive Oil, chillis, salt & pepper to taste. The best and freshest Greek or homemade yoghurt; quality Olive Oil and Feta are ideal. We love it!

Normally cream cheese is not one of the ingredients, but it can work to firm watery yogurt used in Europe/Usa etc.
