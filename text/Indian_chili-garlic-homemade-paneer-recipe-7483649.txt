I followed the recipe exactly and had high hopes, but the final dish fell flat. I tasted the marinade before I added the cheese, and it was FIERY in a good way. I used store bought paneer since I picked this recipe to use paneer that I had on hand. I marinated the paneer for 5 ½ hours and fried it in ghee until it was spotty brown with a few very caramelized spots. The paneer had none of the flavor from the marinade and the texture was drier than it was in other recipes I've made. I’m not a chef, but is it possible the acid in the marinade pulled some of the moisture from the cheese? The yogurt dipping sauce was good on the fried cheese and we ate the paneer with basmati rice and naan. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. I’ll stick to the paneer masala recipe I have next time.
