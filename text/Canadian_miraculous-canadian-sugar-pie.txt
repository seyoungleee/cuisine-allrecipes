Very nice! Made this several times, following the recipe.

I made this for the first time the other day and everyone loved it.  I added 3 packets of True Lemon and also 1 tsp of Lemon juice.

Turned out great. I used almond milk for more sweetness. Love that it makes it's own crust.

I used a pie crust because I didn't read the recipe correctly. It was amazing. I am definitely making this again.

A little too sweet for my taste. However, I can see this being a good base for other treats.

Followed the recipe. Wondered if the batter was too runny, but it turned out great. Perfect for when you want something sweet but also want to use minimal ingredients with minimal effort.

Possibly the worst version of this pie. It does not taste anything like the Quebec sugar pie, it lacks sugar, and has a strong egg taste. Just a waste of time and money

No, not even close! ... "Miraculous" is the last word I would use to describe this pie! Not sweet enough, the filling is bland, more like a custard and has an unpleasant egg aftertaste. 

A real good French-Canadian sugar pie recipe would NEVER ask for eggs or milk, even evaporated milk! Our best sugar pies are made with brown sugar, heavy cream and/or Eagle Brand condensed milk; they are much sweeter, richer in taste, buttery and creamy and often contain maple syrup too.  You know you have a perfect sugar pie when each bite is a party of flavors that melts in your mouth and that the texture is like velvet on your palate.

Love that it made it's own crust.  Definitely a keeper!

Had to make a quick thank you for a good friend, this was super fast, easy and absolutely wonderful. 
Didn't change anything except I swapped a small amount of heavy cream for a 1/4 of a cup of the milk.
Perfect pie ! Thanks for the recipe.
