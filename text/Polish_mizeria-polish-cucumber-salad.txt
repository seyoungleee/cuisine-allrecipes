I made this dish for my Polished themed Christmas eve dinner. It was a huge hit and everyone raved about.I was extremely happy with the results of this recipe.

Is it possible that only 2Â½ tablespoons of sour cream was used to make this?  I too added a little onion and loads of loads of pepper and had to add more sour cream.  All in all good taste but something seems off with the measurements.

This is the recipe my Polish family always made for every holiday and occasion. I love it! Pretty sure they used white vinegar instead of  the lemon juice. Since the seedless cukes are available now, I use those and they are PERFECT for this recipe!

I like this recipe a lot ,I made this to the letter .However what did because I made 5 times the amount on the recipe .I made the dressing and salted the cucumber let it drain.here is how I kept it great.I keeped the cucumbers separte from the dressing .When I was going to eat it I put it together at least 1 hour before I had the dinner .It retained the flavor and the texture .That way I had enough for  the week.

Super simple to make. Easy to adjust to your own taste. Might add jalapeno next time!

Easy and delicious. If you have time to let it sit in the fridge for 3 or more hours, even better. We love dill so I put a lot in.

Great recipe. Made it as written the first time. Second time, I added onion and omitted the sugar. My son loved it too!

I grew up in a Polish family and we had this frequently!! I still enjoy it when the garden gives us fresh cucumbers and dill!

This was delicious as is. Made it for our book club dinner with Polish theme.

I made this for New Year's Eve.  Easy to throw together, and everyone inhaled it--wish I'd made a double batch!

Very refreshing side dish, reminiscent of one my Mother used to make.  I used red wine vinegar and added more sugar and dill than was called for.
