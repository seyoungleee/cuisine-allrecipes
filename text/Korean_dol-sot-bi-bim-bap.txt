If I must say so myself....

I usually don't find bibimbap recipes that use brown sugar. This is an interesting addition. I think next time I may try this, just to see what the taste differenc e is. Otherwise, this seems like the usual bibimbap recipe that is always great!

Awesome recipe!  Didnâ€™t add or change a thing!  Everyone loved it!

So fun and delicious!

Timing is everything with this recipe. The layers of flavor and texture are wonderful.
I served a loose fried egg (non stick pan with minimal olive oil) instead of the raw egg and use a high quality steak. In addition I used white s'rooms saluted with the other veg. My husband loved this meal. 
A Very worthwhile recipe it won't disappoint.

I made this for my son's birthday dinner, and it was a huge hit.  Everyone young and old enjoyed the meal and had fun with it. Definitely a keeper!

This is a very very good, delicious recipe!!  My Korean bro in law loves it, which says a lot!  Also, I made this for Christmas dinner for about 8 people and people raved about it!!  Did not use stone bowls, or nori sheets, I always use the cucumbers and carrots and of course the meat marinade I make exactly how the recipe calls for and it is very authentic tasting:). Make it!  You won't be disappointed!

One of the members reviews was very helpful, which I followed. Used agave instead of sugar.

Better than any I've eaten at restaurants. Make sure to use fresh ingredients, good gochujang, and don't be stingy with the sesame oil

This recipe is time consuming, but definitely worth it. I made it exactly as is, and it was wonderful.

This is a great, easy to make and non-time consuming recipe. I used only 1/4 cup of brown sugar, substituted the beef for ground turkey, zucchini for cucumbers, omitted spinach, used regular white long grain rice, and used Schiracha. I also added some Daikon. No stoneware needed. It was delicious! This is indeed a very flexible recipe!
