Cut them like "watermelon sandwich". Is a great appetizer. You could not go to either a party or family reunion and not have this at the table.great recipe, thank you for posting this!

Love this spread!  I used a half cup of mayo and sour cream.  I added a quarter of an onion and garlic as well.  I used a food processor to make it a smooth spread and it turned out to be a total winner for the whole family.

I really enjoyed these and the spread brought back memories from childhood. I did make  one change and I'll explain why. The change I made was with the SPAM. My husband and I both have a little bit of a texture issue when it comes to SPAM so my idea was to only blend half of it in with the cheese mixture. I minced the other half of the can and threw it in a skillet and browned it up real nice. The blended spread tasted good on its own but the added texture of the crispy SPAM in the mix really bumped this one up in my opinion. This was a fun little recipe and I plan on making it again the next time we have a food day at work.

OMG!Memories...memories! Love these. One of my favorite savory appetizers that I have enjoyed these one ever since I was growing up in Puerto Rico. A thousand thanks. The one thing I always do is to cover the platter where I put these with one or more paper towels dipped in a bit of  milk (just moisten)in order to prevent the bread to dry out. Delish!
