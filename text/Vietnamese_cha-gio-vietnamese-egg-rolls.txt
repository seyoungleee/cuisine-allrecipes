These taste just like our favorite Vietnamese restaurant (only cheaper!)    My husband and son will not eat any others now.  The ones in the store and FF places are almost ALL cabbage and NO FLAVOR. (However, we still really like JITB ones!)

They freeze well, BUT, make SURE you cook them BEFORE freezing.. my first time, i found they got sticky and ripped when I defrosted them and attempted to fry.

 Fish sauce really smells AWFUL & I found you HAVE TO USE IT to get the correct flavor.  I dislike oysters, but I love oyster sauce!

If you're leary, find a large oriental market to find a small bottle of the fish sauce. I got a 1.5 oz bottle the first time.

I was introduced to Vietnamese Egg Rolls back in 1986.  Although they were different than Chinese egg rolls, developed a taste for them.  Today I make the mix up and let it sit in the fridge 24 hours.  I used Wood Ear mushrooms instead of Shiitake mushrooms.  I will make this more often now that I have the recipe at my fingertips!!!

easy and great tasting. I used ground turkey instead. much healthier. cut the cellophane noodles into small sections after boiling to make mixing easier. also I used syrup to seal the wraps works great.

Was looking for these egg rolls for 30 years. I had a Vietnamese friend as a kid and his mom made the best food, especially her egg rolls. Lost touch with the family while I was still very young. Had many egg/spring rolls in my search to find that very specific taste. This was finally it! I had to rush a freshly made egg roll to my mothers house and she confirmed it was the egg rolls we have been reminiscing about almost my entire life. Thanks for this amazing recipe!

Loved it!!! Great recipe, thank you. FYI the local grocery store like Harris Teeter has all the ingredients I needed.

Delicious!  The only variation I made was to use 1/3 cup filling in each egg roll.  I used "Dynasty" Egg Roll Wrappers and the 2 Tablespoons of filling seemed a bit scant.  So I followed the instructions on the package.  They turned out awesome!  Definitely a keeper!

Nice recipe “Similar to other recipe offered online!  You can’t go wrong with either.

Everyone in my family thought this was very good. I added about a cup of shredded cabbage. We used lumpia wrappers that were about 7.5 inches square and thought they were the right size. We used about 3 heaping tablespoons of filling per wrapper. If you use more than that you risk having a  blowout (personal experience). It's fun to get everyone sitting around the table rolling them.

I use italian sausage instead of pork for a little extra flavor.  Decent recipe.  I'm gonna try an air fryer next time, though, to see if they turn out as well without all the extra oil.
