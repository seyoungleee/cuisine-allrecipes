I'm happy this recipe worked out for Soup Loving Nicole and Cookie Lover! :-) As the author of this recipe, I want to point out an error in the ingredient list. If you are using annatto, omit the turmeric. If you do not have annatto, use 1 tablespoon paprika and 1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric.

I made this as written, it is wonderful!! I keep mine in a smaller canning jar. I just shake and measure. Brightens anything I put in in. Chili, baked chicken, Mexican rice dishes. So very good. Thank you so much for posting and sharing.

5.20.20 ...https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/268797/sazon/ ...  THANK YOU, SuzyQ! Until this recipe, sazon was just a word. Such an easy-to-do blend that I'm certain will be a regular around here. I used in this All Recipes Habichuelas Guisadas. Very good!

Omitted the turmeric. Very easy to make and delicious!

Quick and easy. I suggest you double or triple the recipe if you plan to save it for later use.

Excellent! I use Sazon often and keep in in my freezer. Now I can make my own, it is so simple, AND there is no MSG. Perfect! Thanks for sharing!
