A decent dish with good flavor. You really smell the authenticity of the spices, but I would consider draining out the water of the onions. It definitely won't evaporate.

Very tasty, made no changes

Really tasty dish! I did have to double the curry paste to give it more flavor, and a bit of salt at the end, but otherwise this was delicious and healthy. I think there might be some issues with the directions, as you're not going to be able to "toast" spices and "brown" chicken in a skillet full of stewed veggies - maybe if you cooked these separately in a dry skillet.  There was also confusion over the "halved chiles"; every other chicken bhuna recipe I looked up had the chiles minced.  Are they just for flavor and then you remove them at the end?  I served this over basmati rice - yum!
