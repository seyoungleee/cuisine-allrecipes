I have made these candies a few times and this is a great recipe. I add a couple more tablespoons of butter. My mother-in-law is from Brazil and really likes this particular recipe, and she has been making these candies for years. If you want to make Brazilian coconut candies, you don't need a different recipe.  You do have to cook the milk quite a while, until it is the consistency of carmel. Also, it has to be very cold for forming the balls.

You should use way more coconut, maybe a whole cup, otherwise, it will taste just like cooked condensed milk. Other option is to add some coconut milk to the condensed milk prior to cook.

They were ok.  Like other reviewer said...it taste like a soft flavored tootsie roll covered in coconut.  Not something I would make again.  Took to the office and it was underwhelming.  Friend who is from Brazil said mainly for children's birthdays.  Maybe more a kids treat.

It was fantastic! It really made my day..............

I made this recipe, I risk my self adding a grape inside of each one and it turns great, apparently the grape help the sugar level go a little bit down.

Use a full cup of coconut and cook for 20-25 min stovetop to make it even more scrumptious.

Great recipe! I've made them twice now, and can't get enough of them.

Tasted good but did not come out  like a ball .

very good but need to cook over low for a lot longer to get right consistency.

I first tasted these when we had some good friends from Brazil come to dinner. She brought them as a hostess gift. They were delicious. She explained briefly how to make them, but without a specific recipe. This recipe sounded like the instructions she gave me. They tasted exactly like hers, except that hers contained more coconut, so I added almost a cup instead of 1/4 cup. Yummy!

Delicious! Goes well with a dash of choc syrup on the side. Be careful not to burn the milk!!!
