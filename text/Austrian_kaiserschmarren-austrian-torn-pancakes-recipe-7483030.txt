I didn't want the pieces to shrink too much so I only  caramelized then for a minute or two. Still they came out with nice caramelized edges and a fluffy inside! Great recipe and fun to make!

This was so much fun to make! My family devoured all of it. The only substitute I did was to use cake flour.

My mom made this for us as kids, and my sister just made this for my youngest son and me the other day.  First time I had it in 25 years.  And you dropped this recipe just now was too much fun for me.  I shared your video with my sister, and she shared back the recipe from my mom's old cookbook.  It's in German, and you may have fun translating it as its measurements are quirky, and the process's descriptions are delightful.  I hope you enjoy and thank you for sharing this recipe.  T+FYI we love it with a can of tin peaches or pears and drizzle the fruit juice over the sugared "nuggets" for a little extra flavor.
