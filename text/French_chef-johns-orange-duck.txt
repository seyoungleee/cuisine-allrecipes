We used this recipe as is, no tweaks, today for a hassle-free Christmas dinner.   This was amazingly easy and quick and the results quite impressive.

Great! Just cut back on the salt. Best orange ever.

Chef John never disappoints.

I've been making this regularly as we get delicious d'Artagnan Moulard duck breasts at our markets. I try to find breasts that aren't too thick,  as it cuts down on cooking time. After the saute you have to finish in the oven if they're too thick.
The only thing I add to this recipe is are some fresh orange slices in finishing the sauce. 
Kudos to Chef John for one of the best recipes ever!

I added apricot jam and plum sauce. Extra garlic. Very good.

Turned out really well. I made it as directed with the exception of using white wine vinegar instead of sherry vinegar.  Easy and I would make this again

Prepared this for Christmas dinner some years ago wanting something other than turkey for our meal. So good and well worth the time it takes to prepare. Now this dish is requested every year! Thanks Chef John!

I've made this wonderful recipe twice, exactly as described except stopping the duck at 130F rather than 140 - it was still on the medium side of medium-rare, but fabulous nonetheless.  In tonight's attempt, I lost my head and forgot to make the roux before adding the sauce mixture to the skillet, so had to add the flour as a paste after.  It still came out great.

no changes. omg good

Excellent.    Will definitely make it again.
