This was so good I had the impulse to fill the bathtub and roll around in it. My guest at first said it was good, but as he got further down the bowl, to the chunks of crab and corn, he starting raving. He wanted seconds but I decided to save the rest for myself. A significant change I made was to use fat free cream. This made it much healthier but, believe me, the flavor was still outstanding.

nice recipe, but to make things easier, when you make the roux add the veggies directly to the roux; then the liquids...as real cajan cooks use a darker roux although it does not have the thickening qualities as a lighter roux it will still be good

I've made this about 5 times now! Down in Louisiana we use alot of seafood so this is perfect for us.

This is absolutely amazing I always double it and add shrimp. I use cajun and Tony's creole seasoning. Also I cook it low and slow to let the flavors come together. My family and friends love it!

DELICIOUS!  This was as good as I’ve gotten in a high end restaurant!  I used the crab meat from leftover boiled crabs and added a couple of the potatoes too.

My kids beg for this again and again!  It's so yummy.

i've made this several times.  Its easy . and it is a big hit in my family.  Never stays around long.  Great recipe.Helen

Excellent. Made recipe as stated.

This was a delicious and flavorful soup.  I would make this again.

I make this every Christmas, it is fantastic! I like to  purée the onions and celery so you don’t have chunks of them. It helps thicken the soup too.

Excellent. It didn't say how much Cajun spice, so I used 1 tbsp of Tony's. It was OK for me, but a bit too much for my wife. We will make again, but with 1 tsp of Tony's.
