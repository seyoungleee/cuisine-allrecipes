this waz really good but marinade yer meat 24 hours to 2 days..best used on grill...really good!!  susanlynne

Love it, awesome flavor

Quite good, removed most of the gamey flavor. Definitely reccomend marinating for a day or two. Might need to double recipe, I didn't have enough for exactly 1 and a half lbs of steak.

Awesome marinade my elk steaks were amazing I marinated them for 24 hrs

Taste was good. I found the cooking direction were too long. Some were overdone when I cooked it 5 min. total time(3 min one side 2 other side still too long) I would do med  to med/high grill 2 min each side until internal temp of 120-140.

Absolutely awesome and perfect!
It could not have been any better!

Great marinade! Let both T-Bone and Tomahawk Elk Ribeyes marinade for 6 hrs at room temp and then seared in hot cast iron to mid-rare and let rest for 5 mins. Our dinner guests thought the steaks were delicious!

Really good! I only marinated it for 2 hours and cooked it on the George Foreman and it turned out great. Not gamey at all. I am a hugeeee onion fan, but plan to only use half the dried onions the next time I make it as they were slightly overpowering.

This will be a regular -elkcellent :o)

I've never tried elk before, but my sister gave me some. I marinated the meat for two days. it was great! no gamey taste at all. I served with a sauce of mayo, wasabi and lemon juice for just a bit of kick. this recipe made me an elk fan.  can't wait to let my sister know!
