I was born in the US, but both parents are Chileans-- this recipe is perfect! The right combo of sweet-sour with a foamy top. Most pisco sours are just "pisco margaritas", not sour and not frothy. Many people skip the egg white -- and miss out on the full effect ...

I have been in both countries in Chile they use a kind of what they call Pisco...very different from the peruvian one...different grape!!!!!!!!  I have to say ...better the peruvian Pisco..... sorry if you can find peruvian Pisco...you will see the difference!!!!

This is very good

Experimented with lemon vs lime juice. Lime juice as the recipe specifies, is better.

This is the most authentic recipe I have found to date. It has been the hit of all the parties when I make it. I usually add some lime rind to garnish.

This is the best Pisco Sour recipe I have had, reminiscent of the best Chilean drinks. I have tried Pisco throughout Chile and South America, and no recipe matches the crisp taste of this mix.

I love Pisco Sours!  The first time I had one was here at a local Peruvian restaurant.  Then I went to Argentina and Chile, where, as you said, these are enjoyed before meals.    Great to find your recipe.  Now if I had only brough more Pisco home from Chile with me (it is so much less expensive in the duty-free shop!)
