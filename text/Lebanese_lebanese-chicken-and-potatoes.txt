I make this recipe all the time, use only juice of 1/2 lemon, try adding about 1 tspn each of cumin and "7" spice, or allspice.  I turn the broiler on for the last 20-15 minutes until all the lemon juice evaporates.

I'm surprised more people didn't emphasize how important it is to marinate this dish. I seasoned with salt, white pepper, cumin and all spice and I let it sit for a couple minutes before cooking. Next time I'll marinate with the lemon juice and olive for more flavor. I used chicken legs and the chicken was tender and juicy, but cooked a lot faster than the instructions stated.

We love it. Only thing that I did differently was to use equal amounts of lemon juice and olive oil.

The recipe works perfectly as-written. Great dish that is easy to make and has a unique interesting taste. Made it multiple times from this recipe, always comes out great!

I just used 1/4 cup of lemon juice for three servings.

Very easy to put together and so delicious!

This dish is so easy and delicious as is. We like the extra tang of all that lemon. I used boneless thighs and threw in fresh green beans during the whole cooking time. Sprinkled with feta at the end. It is a super easy peasy weeknight dinner.

I suggest making it up in the morning and letting it marinade all day then take out of fridge an hour before cooking. The cooking time is perfect , just make sure skin is crisp. Also only use fresh lemon juice not bottle kind. I  also put oregano on mine and would even suggest some sherry or white wine . Delicious!!

Added more lemon

Easy to make but not really worth the effort. It's all right.
