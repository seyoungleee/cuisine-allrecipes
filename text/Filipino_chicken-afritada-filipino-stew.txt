Made it as stated didn’t have a wok but it turned out great

The recipe provides a good starting point and one can experiment . To thicken the liquid , I just added flour and it became a rich sauce with the three liters water in. I don’t have carrot but it doesn’t matter. I also pan fried the chicken with salt and pepper first in small amount of butter to give it a nice brown  colour and deeper taste. This butter plus the “natural fat” from the chicken was enough to sauté the garlic and onion in later. Then I just took the chicken out. I also added smoked paprika powder to dish. For the tomato sauce, I just mixed tomato paste with some water and added dried rosemary, thyme and basil to soak in and give it added flavour. This is the first time I tried it and served in our fellowship. Everyone liked it. 😊

I added mushrooms, paprika and cloves.  No red bell pepper, no ginger..

Getting my Filipino recipes done in case I get have a craving.

Way too much water and the potatoes didn't cook through.  The potatoes should be cubed not quartered and the dish needs only one cup of water not three.  A very disappointing dinner.

so easy to follow

easy-peasy recipe.  My husband and kids love it.
