Excellent and so easy to make.

OMG, the Norwegian man of the house was so proud and excited that we found such a great recipe!  We use the flatbread as a wrap around European seiners for the savoury aspect.  Next I will try it with GF flour.  Thank you!

I've now made this three times and this last time I rolled it on a floured towel as suggested - it is indeed easier. Had it with cream cheese and smoked salmon. SO GOOD!

I made this last night and it was a hit! The only change I made was cutting the ball into more than 8 sections because my pan was pretty small.

Followed the recipe. It came out very nice. Will make again.

Excellent and so easy to make.

I joined this site so that I could tell Chef John how easy his recipe is. I followed it to a T, and the lefse slices were small but delicious. Iâ€™ll be making them again.

Sort of a cross between potato pancakes and crepes. Next time will try with smoked salmon.

They are also fantastic with swedish meatballs.

delicious and tender, even just using milk i loved it!
