I served this recipe the 4th of July and it was well recieved.  The only change I made was to soak the sliced fruit in the rum for a couple hours before mixing and serving. I'll serve this again.  Thumbs up!!

Served this for a Sunday afternoon party and it was a hit!!

Great. I used spiced rum and orange slices and left out the soda.

I've made this several times, it's always a hit!

I always make Sangria for  a "Girl's Night Out" Party.  I usually make the recipe Sangria Sangria (Red Sangria) and it is always a hit.  This year I made the Sangria Sangria Recipe and this recipe.   This one was a huge hit!  The ladies told me to bring this from now on and forget the Red.    I followed the recipe as written with one modification.  Since I was going to be out of town for a week prior to the party I knew I'd be strapped for time so before I left on vacation I made batches of the Sangria... mixing the wine, rum, sugar and orange juice and I froze it in freezer bags.  The day of the party I prepared the fruit and bagged it.  Then at the party I put the frozen sangria mix, added the soda and the fruit.   A gallon freezer bag holds a double recipe.   The extra is in the freezer for entertaining this summer.

Loved this recipe.  Used blueberries and strawberries.  Not too sweet, very refreshing,

Great recipe! Only change I made was using ginger ale instead of sugar and soda. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious!  Added slices of orange in the mixture and also some frozen raspberries.  We loved it!

This is a very good recipe. Everyone I served it to really liked it a lot. I happened to see lemon rum in the liquor store, so I used that, and it worked really well. Gave it an interesting taste.

A crowd pleaser. made a few minor changes. used flavored seltzer instead of soda. Added A bit more sugar  to make up for the lack of sugar from the soda. Cut rum in 1\2. I did freeze the grapes for the look more than the flavor. Thanks
