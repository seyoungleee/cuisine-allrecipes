This is excellent. The second time I made it I used sesame oil instead of vegetable, Rice vinegar and added some Gari (pickled ginger) Brought it to work and everyone raved!

This is alright, but not great. The recipe should specify RICE vinegar as white vinegar is to pungent. There should also be some honey as is traditionally use in Korea. The sesame seeds don't need to be fried, just toast them in a dry pan. Replace the vegetable oil with dark sesame oil and add directly to the sauce mixture.

This recipe is easy to make and very tasty.

went well with dumplings and chicken fried rice, Korean style.

I made the dressing and then made my own salad with fetta cheese and Greek olives. and lettuce It was delicious  And i spiraled my cucumber to make it interesting.

I made the changes as seen in other reviews, rice wine vinegar instead of white vinegar, sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and added 1 tbsp sugar.  I let it marinade for two hours.  Very tasty and easy to make.

I also added honey to mine, and used rice vinegar, not white. How refreshing and tasty, will def make again!

Nice base recipe for a relatively low cal/hi flavor iteration.  Thanks for the inspiration!

Yum!  Used rice vinegar like others suggested and added a little white sugar and honey.  Super good!

Like others I used rice wine vinegar a sesame oil and I used Korean chili peppers. I also used organic Persian cucumber instead. I didnâ€™t have carrots or green onions in stock but it turned out great!  Not as good as my Korean moms recipe but Thanks for the recipe!

I think I did not add enough cucumber and added too much chilli flakes. It was really spicy for a salad and too vinegary.
