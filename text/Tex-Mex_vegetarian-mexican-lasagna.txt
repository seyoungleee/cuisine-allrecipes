This dish was a hit with the whole family. Followed recipe exactly, other than adding a little extra spinach since we love it. The ratio of veggies and cheese and corn tortillas is perfect ! The enchilada sauce and salsa you use can vary the flavors to your liking, which is perfect. I used green enchilada sauce, next time I will try using red.

I'd make ti again because it's easy, but wasn't great. May even leave ricotta out next time and jsut use cottage cheese

Vegetarian family loved it!!

This was better than I thought it would be! And it happens to be gluten free too! I couldn't find enchilada sauce so I used another jalapeno sauce I found at the store. Excellent!

Loved this dish. Great flavor and it appealed to my vegetarian grandson and everyone one else. They all ask for the recipe.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I added pepper jack cheese between the layers as well as more on top, omitted corn while doubling the beans, and used low carb tortilla wraps. My husband and I will most definitely enjoy this lasagna again and again!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta and chopped chilies for the jalapeno. This will go into my menu rotation for sure.

Great vegetarian recipe for my collection - everyone liked this. Used cottage cheese instead of ricotta. Cooked frozen spinach in the microwave first, then mixed into cheese mixture. Topped with cheddar/pepper jack mixture. Didn't use the full two cups of cheese in the cheese layer, probably 1 3/4 cup.

I thought it was amazing The only change I made was the cumin as I didn't have any even though I thought I did. So I subbed and curry instead.

It was so filling and overall not difficult.

oh this was GOOD!  thank you for the great recipe
