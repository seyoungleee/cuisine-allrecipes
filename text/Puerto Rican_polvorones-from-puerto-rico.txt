The recipe tastes very good but is not the typical polvorones. Texture is totally different. I had to Google more recipes and exactly like I remembered it doesn't need eggs. I think that was the difference in texture.

I added one cup of Almond flour with 2 cups of flour and to the recipe. It was perfect. I baked for 12 minutes instead of 15 but that might be my oven!

We followed this recipe and when complete they were awful.
