I keep a batch in the fridge to put in various Middle Eastern dishes.  When I ran out,  I  bought a bottle from a spice shop.  This recipe is much better.  My experience has been that it lasts months of refrigerated.  Thanks for submitting this great recipe.

Easy, delicious. Followed the ingredients exactly. Served with a side of baked acorn squash. Wow!!
