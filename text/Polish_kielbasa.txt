Pshaw!  My husband and his whole family are Polish and they said these reminded them of home.  I liked them too, and I can hardly find Poland on the map(ha).  Thanks for the recipe.

If you're looking for real Polish food, this isn't it.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I used just ground beef and loved how it tasted.  I will be using this in a lot a different ways.

Sausage is great as written, only thing I did different was to grind my own meat. I used the biggest plate my grinder has. I do this so I know exactly how much fat content the final product will have. Also I find that pre ground meat is to fine and makes for a crumbly sausage.

Just a tip,  I never ever boil my sausages, you will loose a ton of flavor.

This is excellent polish sausage, however, this is NOT kielbasa.  I grew up in Detroit, eating real polska kielbasa from the Kowalski plant in Hamtramck.  Eating this made me nostalgic and long for home.    Again, excellent polish sausage, but not REAL kielbasa.

We have a smoker, and we are going to try to smoke it in there. :) Should come out alright.

I nixed the liquid smoke. I cooked it a bit too long on the grill but it still tasted great. I froze the raw sausages and they really are perfect to have on hand.

This is an awesome recipe, I prefer to add more liquid some then calls for. Also, using the large casings, making a good sizes link, I only get about half of what is stated.
