I made this just as the recipe was laid out. We loved it! The sauce was very aromatic and tasty. The instant pot made the cooking fast. The veggie prep was a little time consuming, but thats because were so used to getting a bag of frozen and throwing them in the pot. The flavor made the radish peeling all worth it. Served with mashed potatoes and a nice green salad. My wife still works so I do a bit of the cooking, happy wife, happy life with this dish.

Sauce was great, although a bit sweet. I made the mistake of buying the traditional thin cut Korean ribs (about a quarter inch slice) and the cook time was way too long, resulting in the meat almost disintegrating.  I'll definitely try the recipe again with  a thicker cut of meat or less cooking time. I found another recipe on line that recommended a 1 minute cook, 5 minute natural release for the thin cut ribs. I almost didn't add the radishes, but they turned out very tasty and not at all bitter after being cooked.

I did reduce the sugar a little, but otherwise made as instructed. It was great! I’ll definitely make it again!

Everyone enjoyed this dish. If I make it again I’d reduce the sugar and add more carrots and possibly mushrooms at the end. I didn’t peel the radishes and served the dish with rice. My instant pot took about 15 minutes to heat  so it definitely took longer than 35 minutes to cook. My husband used the leftovers to make a vegetable soup adding more carrots plus broccoli mushrooms and left over rice. Delicious.

We really loved the flavors of the meat and gravy.  I would maybe add a few minutes of cooking time, since some of the meat was more tender than others.  Also, I would add more carrots and radishes to the mixture.  They shrink up in the Instant Pot and it could have used more.  We'll definitely be making it again!
