This was my mothers recipe almost to the "T".  a couple of things i have learned from making it over the years: 1.  before putting on the cream cheese freeze the crust for a few hours, will make your life a lot easier 2. adding vanilla adds an excellent little flavor (it does get hidden amongst the flavors but you can tell its there) 3. soaking the bananas in the pineapple juice (dont get the heavy syrup kind) will keep the bananas from turning brown before you get to serve it.  plus the pineapple/banana juice you just made tastes good too!!!

Took this to a dinner party last night for dessert. Everyone liked it, but we all agreed that it needed more banana and more chocolate. I omitted the nuts due to dietary restrictions. Only used 8oz of whipped topping-16oz seemed like way to much. I also only used a 6oz jar of maraschino cherries - again, I think 16oz would have just been too many. Overall, it was good, but I will look for a different dessert recipe next time.

This is an awesome desert. Haven't made it in a quiet a while, but with a family dinner around the corner, couldn't think of anything but this great desert.  Everyone give it a try and you will love it too!!! ðŸŒž

Light, fluffy, easy to make.

Great recipe

My daughter made this for our father's day get together and everyone loved it! Light and refreshing.

wonderful!

Allergic to bananas.  So instead will use pineapple and coconut as "allrecipe" said she did. Or drained fruit cocktail like when I make Punch bowl cake.

Super yummy! My father in laws favorite cake

I thought this was an AWESOME SIMPLE DESSERT. I used just strawberries no bananas one time. The other time all pineapple but added coconut awww man. Definitely nothing to sneak and eat thru the night.

It's simple and delicious! Great cold tree!!
