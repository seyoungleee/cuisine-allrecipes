I am an Indonesian living in the US. This is my favorite dish and I am glad I found the recipe here. Thanks for sharing!

My husband is Indonesian, and I myself spent 10 years working there. There are a lot of Indonesian foods I miss, telur balado being one. This recipe was quite good, but I added serai (lemon grass), daun jeruk (lime leaves) & kemiri (candle nuts) to the sauce & a little more cuka (vinegar). That's the way I've always seen it made, and Indonesian recipes can vary a lot from area to area. Pretty good, although I had to use half the chili peppers recommended, we ate everything pretty fast.  It's not quite the flavor I'm used to, but still delicious. Terima kasih until resep ini. Tolong publish resep untuk kentang balado juga, Ibu :-)

I've lived in Indonesia a long time ago and so I wanted to recreate some dishes from there for my fiance, he LOVED this dish! He constantly asks me to make it again, I don't usually have shrimp paste where I live so I use anchovies instead (I looked it up as a substitute for shrimp paste) and it works just fine.

Hot sauce...very different but not bad.
