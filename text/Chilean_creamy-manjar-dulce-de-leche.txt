My experience is the same as lutzflcat. Reduced recipe to 1/8 (1 pint), wisked it often and ended up with a product the consistency of shortening, but somewhat grainy. The biggest difference is I used no sugar, only Truvia Sweet Complete. I'm thrilled to know I was able to get the same results with a sugar-free alternative. Love it in my morning coffee and on the apple of the day! Finally I can feed my caramel craving guilt-free!

5.30.21 I scaled this recipe down to using 1 pint of milk, and when I took it off the heat, it probably was  reduced in volume 75%, so plan accordingly.  I found whisking rather than stirring worked better, and it appeared to have arrived at the consistency I wanted at 40 minutes.  It did firm up substantially when cooled, however, I wanted to use it as a drizzle on some brownies, so allow for that in your timing.  It does taste awesome, but the texture of it is not what I’m used to with dulce de leche, and maybe this  shouldn’t be.  Just not as creamy and a bit on the grainy side.  Honestly, I think I’ll just stick with canned dulce de leche, but thanks for sharing your recipe.
