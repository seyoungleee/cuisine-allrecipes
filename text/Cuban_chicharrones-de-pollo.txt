I really liked the flavor of these. The recipe never did say where to add the cumin and oregano. Because the amounts were small and because of the order they were in the ingredient list, I chose to add them to the beaten egg mixture. I used chicken breast tenderloins and they worked well. Cook time was spot on. They were crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.
