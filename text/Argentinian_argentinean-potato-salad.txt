very very good! I substituted fresh peas and corn instead of canned and didn't change another thing. My argentine husband LOVED it. Thank you so much for sharing :-)

Good, economical salad to bring to a party.  A bit dry, however.

Made as directed, and it turned out dry.  Needed more dressing, but my potatoes were on the large side.  I found  the flavor weak, so I did add more dill, salt, pepper, another squeeze of lemon, and garnished with a sprig of fresh dill.  I steamed some frozen peas and carrots rather than using canned, and they provided a nice splash of color.  The lemon juice and dill weed are unique and key to this recipe, so don’t omit.  This turned out pretty well, but not convinced I’ll make again.

Excellent salad. Fast to make and great flavor. Adding the olives gives it a perfect touch!

Tasty potato salad--I followed the recipe as it is, and would make it again.

My husband's favorite potato salad. Followed recipe except for the can of veggies. We used fresh sweet corn kernels, green beans, new Yukon Gold potatoes and carrots from our garden along with frozen peas in this. I  also added a tablespoon of Silver Spring Beer N Brat mustard. Yum!

It has a perfect taste and a bit of spice thank you!! This was delicious!

Made this for our Argentina moto GP night everyone loved it , i added more mustard to give it more bite .

Good potato salad. Easy to make. It's important to not over cook the potatoes otherwise it gets gummy.

This was awesome! I did everything as written only I added an extra egg because we love eggs in potato salad. Thanks!

It was absolutely delish my whole family loved it and it is better the next day
