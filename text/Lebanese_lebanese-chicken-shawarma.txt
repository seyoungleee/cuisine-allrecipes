I wasn't sure what to expect because we had never had Shawarma before, but, this was very tasty!  I ended up working late, so, the chicken marinated about 13 hours.   It was very tender and the different flavors worked well together.   I am not sure what shawarma is supposed to taste like, but, we liked this recipe.  I served on mediterranean pita bread with tomatoes, lettuce, cucumber, red onion, feta, and a lemon yogurt sauce.

Tasted just like late night shawarmas after a few hours at the bar. We put it in a pita with lettuce, tomato, onion, and hot peppers, and a healthy amount of toum and it brought me right back to the Byward Market at 3:00 AM.

Made the recipe as is. Was not pleased with the result. Chicken was dry, covered in a pasty sour tasting coating.  I won’t make it again.

Loved it!!!

I made the recipe today. Followed instructions. Was disappointed. Flavors were good but marinating in yogurt left a paste on the chicken which neither my husband nor I cared for. It made the chicken seem mushy.
Won't make it again.

This recipe is fabulous with intense flavor.  I'd like to try it on the grill.  I used fresh ground coriander since my ground coriander was old and lost its flavor, and a little extra garlic.

Great combination but the chicken was a bit dry. Second day we had leftovers for lunch and I added Tsatziki and Humous.. was REALLY good!

We’ve made this s few times. Easy and very favourable. Chicken always turns out tender.

Very good!!! I also made rice with turmeric seasoning.
