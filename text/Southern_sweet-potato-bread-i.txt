Absolutely LOVED IT!!!!  I doubled the recipe.  Then added only 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar.  instead of oil I added 1 cup homemade apple sauce.  Instead of water I added apple sauce.  It turned out awesome.

I was not a fan at all.

Loved it.  I will cut down on the amount of sugar next time.  ðŸ˜Š

Loved it! Substituted butter for oil, ube for the sweet potatoes, and hickory nuts instead of pecans. I had to take it into work, or I would have eaten it all. It was a struggle to leave any for my partner!

A easy quick delirious treat that wreaks of the fall!!

Absolutely make it again, was loved by all in my household.

Thank you for this! Recently diagnosed with major allergies, I have lost the will to cook & bake. What I did differently from recipe when doubled-1c ea white and brown sugar, 1c applesauce, 1/3c oil, 3 c oat flour, 3/4tsp nutmeg, 1/4tsp ginger. Made into muffins baked at 400 for 14 mins (convection). Everything else was the same. These were moist and flavorful.

Great recipe I added half a cup of raisins and a glaze at the end ! Taste great

Didn't change a thing but perhaps a bit more  potato because I didn't want to waste it. Turned out terrific. Thanks.

Made this for my husband and he says it reminds him of the ones his Grandmother made for him as a little boy.Great outcome and will try again . Sorry no picture it was gone before I could take one.

We've been making sweet potato MUFFINS with the recipe for years, and the whole family devours them in no time! We always swap the 1/2 cups of pecans for a full cup of chocolate chips though! The muffins are usually done after about 15-20 minutes in the oven. YUMMY!
