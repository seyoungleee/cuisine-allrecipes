Not the healthiest drink on my list, but a great treat every now and then! I halved the recipe and I felt that it tasted VERY sour. When you make it, use half the limes the recipe calls for to create a sweeter drink. My family said this drink "tastes delicious!"

I found this to be just right in proportions. Intense lime flavor and not too sweet. I followed the recipie exactly. We love it as a refreshing antidote to the summer heat. Highly recommended!

Halved the recipe so we wouldn't have leftovers since it doesn't keep well, but had to add a lot more sweetened condensed milk for my tastes - I like my lemonade and limeade sweet! This was really refreshing and I absolutely loved the sweetened condensed milk. I always jump at the chance to use it - I'd eat it straight from the can if I could - so this recipe was just begging to be made! Will make again!

Not quite the American version of lemonade, but tasty. I blended the lime and water in my vitamix then strained it. I poured the mixture back in my vitamix and added the sweetened condensed milk and sugar. This was a unique drink!
