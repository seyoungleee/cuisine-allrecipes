I think there's an ingredient error in this recipe.  It calls for "1/4 drop distilled white vinegar"...I added 1/4 cup, it tasted fine, and I thought it had just the right amount of tartness.  Hopefully, AR will get this corrected.

Will make it again. Used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar which was an interesting twist. Cooking time depends on the texture you desire. Cooked less, more crunch.

I did make a little  change I added another Tablespoon of white vinegar to it.  Next time I want to add some whole cranberries to it.

Love this recipe.It reminds me of my childhood when my German grandmother would make it for us. I did have to add a little more sugar to make it taste just like my grandmothers. My family loves it.

Really, really good comfort food.

I'm on a diet where I can eat ALL the low GI Veggies I want and not a whole lot more.  So the cranberry juice, that already has sugar in it wasn't an option for me but I did have whole cranberries in the freezer from the Holidays so I swapped in those and added just a touch of honey.  I also preferred it cold and added walnuts on top.

I ground some fresh cranberries in water to make the cranberry juice, and used honey in place of the sugar.  This is a really good tasting dish!

I authored the recipe. There is a typo. It should be 1/4 cup vinegar.
