Absolutely delicious!!! Wow!! Made this to accompany fish (sea bass). It was so good! This could be used as a dip with pita chips or used on top of Bruschetta. Recipe is a keeper for sure!!!

Fantastic!This sauce is a combination of a condiment, a bruschetta and a fresh salsa.   Fresh herbs are the stars of this recipe!!Easy to make, fresh taste with versatile uses.Sauce Vierge was wonderful on baked chicken, rice and my favorite on ciabatta parmesan crostiniâ€™s!!!
