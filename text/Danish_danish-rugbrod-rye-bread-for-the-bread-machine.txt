I used a heaping tablespoon of caraway seeds instead of rye flakes and it turned out great and have made it many times??

It is seriously lacking in water.

Delicious bread! My only changes were leaving out the white sugar, as I thought I might find it too sweet, and substituting an equal amount of Extra Light olive oil for the butter.  I read the reviews before making it, and noted the comments about too much liquid, and substituting caraway seeds for the rye flakes.  I initially used the amount of water indicated, along with the optional rye flakes (no caraway seeds), then watched how the dough came together as the machine cycle started.  As it did appear drier than my machine-made breads usually are, I added about 2 Tbsp water, which brought the dough to the moist texture that usually results in a good loaf, for me.  I expect that if I try this recipe again in the future without the rye flakes, the stated 1 1/2 cups of water in the ingredients would probably be fine.  I took it out of the machine after the first rise, gave it a couple of gentle kneads, then shaped it into a loaf and let it rise, covered with a dry tea towel, for an hour in a buttered loaf pan in the oven, warmed by hot water in a pan on the rack below the bread.  It rose beautifully!  I baked it at 375ยบ for 35 minutes, as recommended in the third review.  The result was a lovely loaf with a rather dense texture, as expected, and a fine crumb.
