I cooked it for about 35mins and added a tsp of vanilla powder. Turned out really good.

I have never had a Finnish pancake before, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. To me, this turned out more like a magic cake (a cake on top of custard) than anything else. It was good, though. I did use butter in place of margarine, and I would do so again. The flavor was just sweet enough, but rich and buttery. I wonder if making this more like a German pancake (where you melt the butter by placing the pan in the oven as it preheats, then adding the batter to the hot pan) would yield a slightly different result? (i.e. more "puff"). Regardless, it was something new to try and it was easy to  make! Thank you for the recipe!
