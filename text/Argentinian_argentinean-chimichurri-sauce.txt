5.10.16   Cut back on the water because my tomatoes were so juicy, used fresh oregano (just because I have it), otherwise, followed the recipe.  We had this on grilled boneless chicken breast, and it was excellent.  I think this also would be a great topping for grilled pork tenderloin.  It has a good balance of ingredients, and the red wine vinegar gives it a nice tang.

This was interesting. I liked it with rice, but I felt it had a little too much salt.
