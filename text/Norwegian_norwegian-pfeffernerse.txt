Although it make seem in a past review this recipe is not right, I made it for a class in school and they were delicious! My ancestors were from Norway. and these cookies are pretty easy to make, and they taste really good! thanks.  :)

Something is missing here. Loretta needs to go back and check her recipe. I think she got the titles mixed up. "Pfeffernerse" means "pepper nuts". It's supposed to be a spice cookie with pepper added to zip up the spices even more. It's shaped like a nut, but it doesn't contain nuts. This recipe is for a nut cookie, like Pecan Dreams, which in Scandinavia is made with almonds.

Very delicious! When I took the balls out of the freezer, I wondered how to flatten them, since they were very hard. But I just put them in the oven and they baked out flat and nice.  Make sure to not cook them more than 30 min. They still seem soft after 30 minuets, but they harden outside the oven.

I reviewed this recipe before, noting that these are exactly what my husband remembered his Norwegian grandmother making when he was a kid.  It turns out this recipe is also what my daughter's ice skating coach remembers her German grandmother making as well!  Simply by sharing the recipe you have brought back a bit of childhood for many people (I make these for all of my husband's family as well as the skate coach now).  That has been the best gift ever.  A million thank you's for sharing.  This recipe is Truly a gift.

I absolutely love the texture that the bakers ammonia gives this cookie.  They tasted like little puffs of sugar.  I would add a generous amount, 1-3 tsp, of vanilla extract next time.  Thanks for the post.  It was fun to see what bakers ammonia can do to a cookie.
