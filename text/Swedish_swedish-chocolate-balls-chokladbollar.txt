As usual, Chef John has a winner

Great and easy to make recipe

These taste so good. I don’t even know how to describe them. I had to use what I had on hand: salted butter, table salt, sweetened shredded coconut, & Keurig caramel flavored coffee. I took Chef Johns suggestion and used powdered sugar as an option to avoid a grittiness. I left out the cayenne and I didn’t toast the oats. (I just don’t care for pan toasted oats or nuts personally). One thing I would not substitute is rolled oats for the quick oats. I have tried that in other recipes and the texture is not good. I missed the part about rolling in coconut and I had already stirred it in the bowl. It seemed fine to me. These would be an easy and safe treat for a child to make. Except they seem to melt quickly because of the coconut oil. So, they may be a bit messy. I used a cookie scoop and got 18. Ty so much John.

Loved the ease. Love coffee but didn't like the taste of it in this? Smell was great - taste too bitter for me. Probably just preference. Will try again without the coffee and I'm sure it will be great.

My friends and I love these!!  They are easy to make and relatively healthy!  Can substitute the sugar for stevia and never know the  diff except the calories!  Very, very good dessert!  I even have a party request to whip these up for!!:)
