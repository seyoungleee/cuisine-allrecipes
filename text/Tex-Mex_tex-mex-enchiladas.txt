This recipe was so easy - you had to wonder how good it was going to turn out. However!  They turned out great!
My husb normally fixes the enchilada meals and even he was surprised at how good these were and how quickly you can prepare them!  We have already fixed them x3.  Try it - you will love it!

They came out just how my mother in law makes them so my husband loved them and I thought they came out good too especially mixed with the rice.

The enchiladas were really really good all my friends love them. Of course I had rice and beans to go with it and also bean and cheese nachos it was excellent meal thank you for the recipe.

Really disliked this, the entire family said it was bad.

I wanted to love this but didn’t. They didn’t look appetizing nor taste appetizing.

This was pretty good and fairly easy to make although a second person helping is essential.   One person frying tortillas while the other fills and rolls.

Love Enchiladas! Tried this recipe but didn't want to use canned chili so I made my own. I used flour tortillas because that's what I had on hand. I left out the onions. Will make again!

Very yummy kids ate it all 
We added jalapeños for kick

We moved from Texas to Florida and I have been craving authentic tex-mex enchiladas. I followed the recipe exactly and they are so good!  I made some home made pico and re fried beans to go with them, YUMMMY!  Thank you for letting me go back to Texas, well, at least for this meal!

I had execution problems with this. My tortillas fell apart after being softened in the hot oil, so rolling them just didn't work. I wound up making this "lasagna style", with a layer of sauce, layer of softened tortillas, and then a cheese and onion layer. The taste was out of this world good. I'll probably try to make these again as written with a different brand of tortilla, because YUM.
