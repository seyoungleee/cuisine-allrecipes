Lovely meal.  Must use rice that has been fully chilled or it will clump together.`Also it needs some garlic and additional spices to give it that authentic chinese flavor.

As is, I felt this was a bit bland and didn't taste quite like the Asian style restaurant fried rice that we get around here.  I added some seasoning (garlic, onion and chinese 5 spice) and a about 1 T of teriyaki.  It was pretty good after that.

Delicious - changed the ⅓ cup of soya sauce to ½ cup hoisin sauce.  Not so salty.

A lot of work and it was very bland. I didnt even use all the rice the recipe called for. All I tasted was rice and soy sauce. Next time I want fried rice I will go get take out

We didnt like this as much as other recipes.  I still like making my own Chinese food instead of paying over 30.00 at the restaurant for 2 people.

Was not a good recipe brown rice cooks way longer then it says it’s actually 45 mins

I used stir fried vegetables from Costco and added green onions, delicious!

Very good.  Will happily make it again.

Pretty darn good. My wife and I recently went on a diet (we're blaming weeks of isolation) and thought Chinese food like this would just be something we really, really missed.

Them I discovered the miracle of using cauliflower rice and found it subs in nicely with this recipe.

It was Ok but kind of dry.  Needed something to give it more taste.

Excellent and very tasty. Only added chopped garlic, a little garlic powder, fine ground malabar black pepper.  Sometimes when I eat Chinese food, it feels as though it gets stuck in my chest, but not this one. Definitely a keeper!
