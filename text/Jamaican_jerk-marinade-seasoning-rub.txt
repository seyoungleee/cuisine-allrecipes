This is a wonderful dry rub or whisk into olive oil for a marinade. I didn't have any turbinado sugar so I substituted raw organic coconut sugar.   Makes a large amount but so easy to keep in an air tight container.

I use this on chicken to make kabobs - we all love it!

Have tried a few jerk seasoning recipes.  Probably the best of all of them!

This is Not true Jerk chicken spice mix....Authentic Jamaican Jerk chicken is made with either fresh or dried & ground SCOTCH BONNET peppers.But good try!

Love this! I almost left out the salt and sugar but decided to try as written. It is perfect. The only ingredient I didn't have was the dried rosemary. This is perfect the way it is. Used on chicken thighs on the grill. Hubby loved them and I ate two, even though I was already full. I am trying on salmon today for lunch! Yum.

Tastes amazing

I love this spice blend! I always have this made. And when I run out, I pull up this recipe and make more!

This recipe is top notch! I didn't change a thing and it's better than any store bought seasoning I've ever bought. 

I personally like more heat so next time I'll add more hot ingredients. 

Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome!

Used this recipe for Grilled Jerk Fish Tacos I was making. I didn't make the full batch as I didn't want a ton of it leftover. I omitted marjoram, sage, and rosemary as they were listed as  optional ingredients at the time I printed the recipe and don't seem common in jerk rubs. Combined rub with some olive oil, fresh squeezed orange and lime juice and felt our jerk fish tacos were pretty good! Thanks for the recipe!
