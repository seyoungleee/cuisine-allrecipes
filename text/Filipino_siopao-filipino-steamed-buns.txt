I made this with your chicken asado recipe and it was perfect! Made a bit of taste adjustments but definitely keeping this recipe handy. thank you!

Btw, can I make this and freeze dough? Or I should steam it first then freeze? How long will it last? Thanks!

very nice dough!

The taste is good, but I followed the recipe and the dough didnâ€™t turn out. It probably would help to proof the yeast then add it to the dry ingredients.
