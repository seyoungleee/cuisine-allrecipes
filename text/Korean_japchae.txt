I used sukiyaki-style cut sirloin and bok choy (instead of spinach). I also used a thinner kind of glass noodles than the Korean dang nyun, because these were the ingredients I had on hand. I also used a special soy sauce that had mirin in it. I simplified the steps 3 to 6 by sauteeing the ingredients in the wok, in this order: onions, then beef, then as the beef cooked, julienned carrots, then bok choy (which I had blanched, not boiled). I poured all the sauce in Step 1 onto the noodles, and tossed it to coat evenly. I didn't mix in the veggies and beef, but used them instead as topping. It was delicious! And it tasted so much like the Chap Chae at a favorite restaurant. But I am adding dang nyun to my shopping list, because I plan to cook this again soon!

This is a great flavorful recipe couldn't stop eating it !

Doubled ingredients for sauce. And added more veggies.

I added additional vegetables and used spaghetti squash instead of the potato noodles.  Also used the sauce to carmelize a vegetarian plant based meat product.

OMG IT WAS SO GOOD

Added sesame oil to the sauce mix, used only 3 table spoons of soy sauce, used about 1 tbps of brown sugar. I didnâ€™t taste a difference in the noodles after putting them

Delicious! I did shiitake mushrooms and I added more sauce!!! Yum!!!

Subbed chicken for beef, used veggies I had on hand (onion, bell pepper, shiitake mushrooms, cabbage, spinach, carrots) and topped with pickled ginger...Also decreased the sugar by 1 tbsp...delicious and  better than take-out!

I made this last night, and my 15 year old daughter said "It is the bomb. It's the best meal you've ever made."

I've never had Japchae before, so I've no basis for comparison, but this was absolutely amazing. Didn't have some of the ingredients and it still turned out intensely flavourful. Delicious.
