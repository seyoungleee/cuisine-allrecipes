SO GOOD!  This was very very delicious.  The apples were very tender underneath, and the crust on top was delicious and chewy.  Some changes that I made and found effective:  for sprinkle mixture used brwn sugar instead of white, used about 2x cinnamon, and added 1/4 tsp cornstarch to make sure the apples juices congeled.  I also zested about 1/4 lemon over the apples and squeeze about 1/4 lemon of juice over them.  For the topping, I used 1/2 cup white sugar and a half cup unpacked brown sugar.  THIS MADE IT VERY Excellent.  The crust came to a dark golden brown and was so yummy.  I will definitly make this soon again.

Even with extra apples, this was much too sweet. I wish I'd read some of the reviews about reducing the sugar. Other than the sweetness, this was just okay. Sorry, I don't think I'll be making this one again.

My mom introduced me to this pie as a child..I love it and enjoy making it

I have never been a good pie maker, but this turned out great. The crust was tender yet crunchy. I would add a little salt into the apples next time.

I make this every fall with fresh apples, hands down easiest pie recipe I've ever made

This apple pie was probably the worst one I have ever made. It was thick and unappetizing. Will not be using this recipe ever again.

my pie eating family has decreed this the best pie ever.  I may never make an apple pie with a bottom crust again!

I have been making this recipe for years.  It always comes out great.  If using nuts I prefer walnuts but I usually put in raisins instead.  Not everyone likes nuts

Used half brown and white sugar for 3/4 c total. 
 Forgot the cornstarch but it still set up OK

Easiest apple pie I've ever made!  Family loved it with the delicious crispy topping.

This recipe was delicious. Had everything needed to bake. I will definitely bake this as often as I can. I did sprinkle a mixture of cinnamon and sugar in too before baking.
