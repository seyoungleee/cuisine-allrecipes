We eat these every year.  The dough is a thick batter, thicker than pancake batter, thinner than nut bread.  I dip the spoon into the hot fat in between each "cookie".  It keeps the spoon cleaner.  Sometimes I make a thin powdered sugar glaze and drizzle over the warm cookies.  they make very interesting shapes, and discussing them is half the fun.

To have the “ original authentic best flavour” of these delicious , morsels of heaven , PLEASE, deep fry them in LARD! Yes , yes LARD! Or ….. “ BUTTER FLAVOURED CRISCO “ . It truly makes a HUGE difference . I know . Tiss the New Year… we’ll start it off right ! “ LARD”. ( no carbs).  Mmmmmmmm ( sigh) Cheers 🍷🥂💋

i love the recipe. so much thaty sometimes i dont only make it for new years. it is almost march and im making again! well i hope you all loved it because i know i did. hope you all have a good day:)

Very good. I went a little stiffer on the dough and did them in an air fryer at 370. 3 minutes, give it a shake and another 3 minutes. Little different on the taste from normal and the sugar doesn’t stick to the outside but then we have always dipped in sugar with each bite which worked just the same

I grew up loving when we visited Grandma and she made these over New Years! I tried them for the first time and all loved them - my spouse and kids!

I’ve been married since 1981 to a Mennonite and this has been made every New Years in his and now in our family. His family have referred to these cookies as a ‘donut’.  When eating, a spoon of confectioners  sugar is put on your  plate and the donut is dunked into the sugar before each bite! (No calories there, lol). My recipe is very similar to this except I add a tbsp of sour cream ... my dear Mom-in-law’s Recipe ...   Two years ago I added cinnamon o the flour and small pieces of chopped apple and everyone loved them as they tasted better than a dutchie donut!! Great recipe!

Family variations include putting a prune in the middle of each instead of raisins, using additional flour to make a stiffer dough that can be pinched off and allowed to rise before frying, or my own favorite tweek: add a bit of fresh grated lemon rind to both the batter and the sugar used to toss them in after cooking. A must-have favorite that co-workers now also look forward to having each New Year Day!

These are great. The recipe might as well have been copied directly from my Mennnonite cookbook.  The only changes we make is to roll them in granulated sugar (not icing sugar), and to cook them in lard, rather than oil.  The authentic recipe would never have been cooked in oil, and these taste much better cooked in lard.

I'be been married 34 years to a Mennonite, so I Make new Year's Cookies almost every year for NYD.  Decided to try this recipe this year.  DH says they are the best yet, even better than his mother used to name, and that's quite a compliment coming from him.  Followed the recipe to the letter, and will keep this one for years to come!
