Delicious! So easy!

Fantastic!!I started with four pounds of tomatoes and didnâ€™t peel them or take out the seeds. I just removed the core. I peeled the cucumber and left the seeds in it. Two cloves of garlic and a big pinch of salt. Wonderful and so easy!!

Made it exactly like the recipe!  It is delicious.

I used tomato juice instead of  fresh tomatoes.  Delish!

The recipe calls for green bell pepper, but the video shows Anaheim or Cubanelle.  It's a little sharp with the green bell- I wonder if it would have been better with the other kind of pepper?  I'll keep experimenting.  Thanks.

I wasn't sure I'd like this because I'm not a cold soup fan, but was pleasantly surprised! Delicious! My son loved it too, my husband not so much, although he didn't hate. He said the flavour was too strong and I think that all that raw onion and pepper (even though it was a smooth soup by the time it ended up in the bowls) had something to do with it for him.

I made this for my lunch today. So light, fresh and delicious!!

Delicious! So easy!

Made half the recipe.  But added pepper, and more coke onion, and red pepper.

Perfect for a summer day, when you don't want to put the stove on. It was delicious and easy!
