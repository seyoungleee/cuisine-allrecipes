My late father-in-law used to make borscht for holiday dinners. This is just like his version (for which I did not have a recipe). Thank you so much for posting it so we can carry on his tradition!

We make this way about six times a year.  Never use bay leaf but will try in the next few weeks.  The type of kielbasa sausage is most important.  Want made with pork and garlic and maybe a little beef.  Forget if made with Turkey.  Will make "pour it down the drain Borscht."  The ratio of 3 cups water to 1# sausage is perfect.  We stir in an egg couple of minutes at the end.

Oh my gosh! I love soup, and borscht, but beets upset my stomach, so I was looking for something similar without beets. This is DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe except I doubled the garlic and didn't have any dill. I expect that would make it even better. But oh my - this is my new favorite.

This recipe was as close as it gets to my Grandma's.  Everyone loved it!!

We added 2.5 lbs of blanched Yukon Gold potatoes to this as well as doubled the amount of vinegar. It came out very well.
