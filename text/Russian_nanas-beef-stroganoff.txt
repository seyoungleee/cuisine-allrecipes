It's no wonder I liked this!  With the exception of the white wine, which I really liked, this is the way I've been making Beef Stroganoff since I was a young girl in the early 60s, from a paperback Sealtest cookbook! (Any of you out there old enough to remember Sealtest Dairy?)  Two minor criticisms, however.  First, it is counterintuitive to cook a pretty decent cut of meat like sirloin for "two to three hours."  "Back in the day," when I was making this with round steak, it was indeed necessary to simmer (braise) the meat in beef broth for an hour and a half or so to ensure tenderness. But with sirloin, once browned it didn't need much longer on the stove than it took to pull it all together with the remaining ingredients - ten minutes tops.  Second, the wine should be used to deglaze the pan once the meat is browned, not just before serving as the recipe instructs.  You want the alcohol to cook off.  These, in my view, are two important considerations for the success of this dish.  Also, while I did not measure any ingredients precisely, I do know I used more broth and less flour than the recipe directs.   Finally, don't forget to include pepper with the salt! I served this with hot, buttered egg noodles tossed with fresh chives and a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley for garnish.

Good, but something was missing. It needed more of a beef flavor in my opinion and less of the tomato. I added a little bit of paprika to the sauce and extra sour cream. 3 stars for me and 5 stars from the rest of my family. Serve with coleslaw and mashed potatoes :)
