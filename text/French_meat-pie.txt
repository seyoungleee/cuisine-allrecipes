this was good, i put a dash of cloves in, a dash of all spice and half a tsp of cin, also an oxo cube and a bit more water. lovely!!

Good, but in my opinion, not quite as good as the Meat Pie (Tourtiere). But because I think it has more of an 'expected' taste, it might be a better choice to serve to guests. I didn't think the leftovers were so good, though.

Delicious, but it needs a little more. The filling can be improved with sauteed leeks and mushrooms.

Very tasty and easy to make.  A hardy dish

I must say that chef John's recipes are brilliant and the commentary amusing ðŸ™‚Today was the 2nd time I followed the basic ingredients and instructions on this meat pie- the only better seaquel I have seen was the Terminator number 2

Excellent recipe, I make it a lot it's so good. Have beef gravy over a slice, very excellent.

French Canadian mayhaps? There are several ways of making French Canadian meat pie depending on where in Canada or New England you are from. Its very popular here in Maine , I enjoyed this recipe.

I loved it. I used the already pie crusts (store bought) and it was an easy delicious dish.  I omitted most of the spices.  I only need salt, pepper and parsley in mine, and it was perfecto.This was the second time I made it.  P.S. I used no pork in mine either.

loved it, really juicy, and really good, personally, I think that they should make this in Australia. But overall, I think that just, its too good.

Did for office party, chose to do this instead of empanadas=easier. Added 1/4cup white wine, hot pepper flakes, diced basil tomatoes, oriental 5spice and did a cinnamon sugar crust in addition to most of your recipe. I loved using the dry mustard as it enhanced the meat, mushrooms, and potatoes. Thanks for the great base idea! Now have to make one for me :)

Excellent pie. Just the right amount of seasoning. I used instant potato flakes to thicken it and doubled the recipe to make two pies. This will be my meat pie recipe from now on.
