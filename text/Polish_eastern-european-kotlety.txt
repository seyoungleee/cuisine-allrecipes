Although I have not tried these it is basically the same recipe I use. The only exceptions are I use the trinity of meat: beef, pork and veal. I also brown the patties then put them in the oven covered with cream of mushroom soup for about an hour. Great memories and great meal.

If you enjoy a plainer type of meat patty, then this is for you.  I personally enjoy things with more flavor.  I would try a recipe with a lot more seasonings next time.

Just like Busia's only she would add fresh marjoram or parsley.  Umm!

Loved it! It only took me 11 minutes to prep. Enjoyable Patties.

Very good! I grated the onion, used store-bought bread crumbs, and increased the garlic to two cloves. Everything else was per the recipe. Tasted a lot like grandma's!

Just like grandma made it

Made this recipe with turkey, came out great! If you are following in my footsteps, half the salt....

The Kotlety turned out very delicious. What a great meal; it reminded me of my mom's kotlety.
