This was easy and outstanding. However, I did make it low in fat. I used 3 egg whites in place of the whole eggs and  I used 1/4 cup of applesauce in place of the oil.I sprayed the pan instead of greasing it. Then followed the recipe. It was great served warm from the oven and wonderful cold,too.
It's a keeper!

I also made this recipe according to the directions, and it was not good. Only one person in my house ate it, and they doused it with cream and sugar and ate it like cereal. Very bland. I wouldn't suggest it.

Can also be GLUTEN-FREE with Yahuda Gluten-free Matzos which are just as good as regular matzos.  I love previously suggested substitutes like brown sugar, and applesauce instead of oil.  I also use cranberries instead of raisins.

Very easy (I like easy) and delicious (I also like delicious!)

It's a pretty standard apple matzo kugel recipe. I usually double the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan. I also use a mix of Gala and honey crisp apples so I can ease off the sugar. I also sub in light brown sugar for white. And my mom used to add walnuts to this. I just swap the walnuts for the raisins. And sometimes add some honey in place of some of the sugar. This recipe is infinitely adaptable, and meant to be specialized by each family. Happy Cooking!

Excellent warm or hot!  Used all the other reviewer suggestions (substitute applesauce for oil, half white and half light brown sugar, dust top with cinnamon).

Huge hit! Will be a staple for years to come!

Great recipe. Didnâ€™t really make much of a change but did half white and half light brown sugar, little extra cinnamon, 1/2 tablespoon of orange juice.

So delicious!  We had it with ice cream

I love this.  It even gets better after a couple days in the fridge.

I served this as dessert with whipped cream one night during Passover, and I thought it also made a good breakfast the next day.
