I was a little concerned about using vinegar as a marinade here, but took a chance based on the reviews....it was FANTASTIC! We loved these chops and so did our 2 and 5 year old children. They were super-easy to prepare. You HAVE to keep the onions and do this : make a little tray using two layers of  aluminum foil. Spray it with cooking spray and place (drained onions) on it and carefully place tray on grill, alongside the chops. We cooked our chops on med-hi for 8 mins. exactly and in that time the onions cooked and carmelized a bit and man, they were tasty. Next time I will at least double the onions, they were that good.
Also, I would not recommend leaving the chops in any longer than the 2 hours stated in the recipe.

I found that the meat was tender but had no flavour (I marinated 2 hrs but didn't add the extra spices). The onions were the best part of the dish.

These were amazing!

Super fast to make.  The family (tough crowd) really enjoyed it.

Excellent with goat chops.  Serve hot off the grill otherwise they get greasy and not very good.

This is a good basic and easy recipe. I actually leave it in the fridge over night.

Best lamb chops ever!  My family loves them. Simple yet flavorful recipe.

I made this recipe and it was so fantastic!!!  Wondering how it would be on other cuts of meat?

Absolutely love the marinade... made it for my husband and two year old and they could not get enough... the addition of the cinnamon, all spice and garam masala as suggested by the original contributor makes a world of difference to the taste of the dish.. this has become a family favorite

Easy and flavorful! I'm not a big fan of lamb but my husband loves it. So when I saw lamb chops on sale I thought I'd surprise him (and I'd just eat the sides.) But it was so good I had one!  Will likely try this marinade for other meats as well.

Super easy and super delicious! Next time I might scale back just a smidgen on the vinegar
