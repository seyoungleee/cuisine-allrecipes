This dish was so delicious. We loved the fresh taste of the herbs and all the protein in a vegetarian dish. It was also very hearty and filling. Will definitely be making this again.

I made this last night from the magazine. I had to use fresh mint because I couldn't find dry, whole butter because I didn't have ghee, and spaghetti because that's what I had on hand. It turned out so, so good! I made a double recipe and substituted 1/4 of the water with homemade lamb stock.My advice is to make sure you salt to taste- this factor can truly be the difference between being able to taste all the other ingredients vs just having a flat flavor profile. If you don't trust your palate, serve with a jar of salt at the table.I served this with a cilantro-lime chutney (cilantro, mint, Serrano, jalape√±o, ginger, shallot, lime, salt, olive oil) and sour cream with a little of the chutney mixed into it. And Claire saffitz sour cream chive rolls with the following modifications: infused the butter with saffron, whole coriander seeds, and curry powder. Used ricotta instead of sour cream. Used some of the above chutney instead of chives.
