Great recipe!  One alteration I made on the advice of a local Indian restaurant was to mix 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 3 tablespoons of water and add this mixture and stir well once the greens have wilted.  Then cover and cook for the remaining ten minutes.

I've tasted sag paneer a bunch of times and this one feels like its missing something.......

Added ginger, garam masala, sugar, and tomato paste as suggested by others. Also added some cornstarch, but definitely might want to just do 1 teaspoon is the flavor was there, but it was extremely mushy.

Nice base but needed a touch of sugar and tomato paste. I notice some people have mentioned that it is missing something, and that thing for me was tomato paste and a teaspoon of sugar. Can also use tomato sauce/ketchup without the sugar. Can also add a half to one whole  teaspoon of mustard powder to really get that authentic flavor.

Made it and tasted WAY off. Went to a friend to ask what I did wrong and he said the recipe is missing the ginger and garam masala

I've made this dish twice using a spinach/kale combo and everything went fine.  This is an easy & versatile recipe.

Was delicious and easy to make.  Made it using frozen spinach and ghee. It was a bit too spicy for me but I can’t do spicy. Hubs said it wasn’t spicy to him. I just ate it with a little plain yogurt like I do with pretty much any spicy dish. Definitely plan to make again with the same spice level.

I used kale, spinach, ground cumin, turmeric, salt, pepper,  and some chili lime seasoning.  I threw in shrimp at the end and served it with basmati rice and garlic naan. We really liked it!

Great recipe, I used collard greens, kale and spinach and it came out great!

Excellent Easy Tasty

I'd use less cumin and less salt... other than that it was great!! I used spinach only, no mustard greens.
