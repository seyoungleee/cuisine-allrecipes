Excellent! I did this with homemade Kimchi and it was spicy and delicious. I recommend using a whole teaspoon of sesame oil.

I used mirin instead of white vinegar, and cut the sugar in half as recommended by another chef (and because I dislike overly sweet foods).  Overall, extremely delicious! I agree that the serving size seems small.

I thought it was too sweet with the full tablespoon of sugar. I recommend cutting the sugar to 1/2 tbsp and adding a full tsp of sesame oil instead of 1/2.

This was great!   But I have trouble believing that this is supposed to yield 4 servings.   Maybe hubby & I liked it a little TOO much!  :)

A nice change on just plain Kimchi.  Those who already like Kimchi will love it.  Those who just tolerate Kimchi will like it.  Some family members never will, so gave it 4 stars.  I served with Bulgogi.
