Tastes JUST LIKE a hot and fresh Krispy Kreme donut!  Love it!!!  Easy to make.  Make sure you take the pan of rolls out of the oven before pouring the liquid over them...it will make a mess IN your oven if you don't.  You might have some liquid left over, so don't think you HAVE to use all of it.  I add flaked coconut to the top of the bread after covering with the liquid.

Delicious! Will definitely be making again!

Tasted just like my friends family recipe. I loved the taste and it wasn't too sweet. I just need to get better dinner rolls to make it even better.

Loved it. The recipe was perfect.

Well, I didn't make it the quick and easy way, and they were delicious! I used Angie's Best Dinner Rolls from this site. I used 7 dinner rolls and cut the sauce in half. I had sauce left over. I had never heard of these before, and I'm glad I tried them. They were sticky and sweet without being too sweet.
