I can't get enough of this soup!  I tweaked it by leaving out the bacon and using kale instead of spinach (the famous restaurant uses kale).  I also added 1 teaspoon of fennel as I think that it is crucial to the flavor of the soup.  My Italian sausage was hot enough without the added red pepper, also.  Still, I think this recipe is pretty forgiving and you can add or subtract to your taste.  This was just what I was looking for to start me on my way to my new favorite soup.  I also loved how quickly everything cooked.

I made this soup last night. I used Johnsonville Sweet Basil Italian sausage (which I LOVE) and Campbells chicken broth. It turned out EXTREMELY salty. I can handle a lot of salt in my food, and this was too salty, even for me. I added extra cream, just to try and tone down some of the saltiness. Maybe it might be better with reduced sodium ingredients, but I will not be making this again. Thanks anyways!

Nice hearty soup.  I made this with a few modifications:1. substituted with kale instead of spinach2. added can of drained red kidney beans3. added 1 tea of fennel seeds4. added 1/2 cup of milk5. To reduce the amount of sodium,  used water instead of chicken stock; cooked bacon separately and added it as a garnish after the soup is done.

I loved this! I used less red pepper flakes and I added fennel fronds and some cut up fennel bulb. I added more broth and half and half until it was the consistency I wanted. I didn't add bacon.It was super flavorful!

Great recipe--our go to for Zuppa Toscana.We use kale instead of spinach as it holds up better, al dente

Great soup. I used hot Italian sausage, not so much red pepper flakes, 6 slices bacon, 2 t ground garlic along with fresh, bone broth, 1/2 c cream and 1/2 c milk, a bouillon cube and a dash of Worcestershire. Also used kale instead of spinach. Donâ€™t add any salt until you taste. Hubby loved it.

Best Soup I've ever made.

Very good soup BUT waaay too many pepper flakes I love hot and spicy but with 1 + 1/4 tsps. the excellent flavor of the soup is lost. I used 1/4 tsps. and it was perfect. Can always add more, if desired.

My granddaughter canâ€™t get enough of this soup. I make it by the big stockpot full. I do leave out the bacon. Delicious.

This is definitely a winner and a keeper!  I didnâ€™t have heavy cream so I mixed 2/3 C Ricotta with 1/3 cup whole milk and it was excellent.   Delicious ðŸ¤¤

This is one of the best soups Iâ€™ve ever had. I do add more broth because I double the kale (which I replace the spinach with) and the leaves soak in all the taste. Itâ€™s soooo delicious!
