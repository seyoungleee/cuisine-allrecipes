This whole concept of making scones with soda fascinated me! I used Sprite. They were so easy to make, came out very tender, and tasted like a light biscuit with no lemon flavor at all. I didn't have lemon curd or mock Devonshire cream, so I iced the top of mine with a lemon glaze. I will definitely keep these in mind for my next tea party.

I followed the directions to the tee. While the lemon glaze was fabulous, the scones themselves were flat and tasteless. I was so disappointed as I had baked them for a get together and couldn't serve them.I won't be making again

These were perfect.  Quick and easy. Light and fluffy.  I added a lemon glaze that added just the right amount of sweetness. The trick is to NOT overwork the dough.Thank you

I should have known better. 2 wet:3 dry ratio will produce a batter, not a dough. I had to add more than 1/2c flour and bake almost 30 minutes. Even with added craisins, almonds and orange zest, they were lackluster.

The texture is wonderful! I did add lemon zest and dried blueberries. Very good!

Quick, easy! Use San Pellegrino Limonata for best Pop of flavor!

I love lemon so i thought that this was the best thing ever!
