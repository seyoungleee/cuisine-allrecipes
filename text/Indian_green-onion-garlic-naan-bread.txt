followed recipe to a T. flavorful and ce out yummy. I suspect I would have to roll out a few hundred of these to get the true thickness. I had good luck brushing off extra flour w a bristle brush. thanks Chef John. you rock!might try next batch w some toasted cumin seeds.

Turned out wonderful! Love the chef here. Reminds me of  on Ross- itâ€™s okay- no mistakes.

I have no idea what I'm doing wrong.  I added more than an extra cup of bread flour, and the dough is still so sticky that it smears across the counter as I knead.   When I rolled it out, it stuck both to the counter and the rolling pin.  I had to liberally coat each naan with flour just to get it to the pan and ended up having to clean burnt flour out of the pan between naans.  I've checked and double checked the recipe and my measurements, and I still have no idea what I'm doing wrong.  Note:  The final product is still delicious, but getting there is almost impossible.

I used 120 grams of flour weight, that is 180 grams total for the recipe. However, I needed to add quite a bit more flour so I could work with it. But, ultimately, it turned out great. Soft and chewy. Thanks, Chef John.

So I know better but I only had plan yogurt rather that Greek. Had to add a good bit more flour and tossed in some olive oil. Still came out really good and I had more this way. It all got eaten so that's telling.

Came out pretty good. I think I didnt knead it long enough as it was quite sticky and didn't rise well in the pan. However the flavor was great and they were still quite enjoyable

I love it just as it was made in the video

Love EVERYTHING that Chef John makes
