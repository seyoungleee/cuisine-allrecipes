Easy

The whole process was great but I didn't enjoy the seasoning.  I mixed all ingredients in a bowl before adding the chicken, and even though I cut back a bit on the 3/4 cup of lemon juice, the end result was still too lemony and otherwise bland for my little family.  I'll probably use broth instead of juice next time, and add a little salt, plus brown on a higher temperature before baking.

I liked it but my husband and daughter did not.

This was excellent! The chicken stayed moist and had a ton of flavor. I was unable to find thighs due to the panic in the country right now so I just used extra drumsticks. This recipe is a keeper!
