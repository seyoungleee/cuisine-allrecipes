I Hope that people read this review before running out and buying ingredients.  NOTE:  There is NO rice wine vinegar...IT IS JUST RICE WINE OR SAKE...NOT VINEGAR!

I have been making this recipe for a while now and it is great.  I just wanted to mention that the "rice wine" should NOT be rice wine vinegar.  In case anyone got confused.  You can also substitute sake for the rice wine.  My family loves Chinese food and this is one of our favorites.

This was okay. I just felt there was something missing. I think it needed way more garlic. Don't think I will make it again though.

Didn't taste exactly like a restaurants, but it was very good! Will definitely make again

It was not bad as a first attempt! I need a hotter wok! I am going to buy an outside burner stove! My inside gas stove does not cut it. Flavor was good but could be better! Chinese needs to be cooked over nuclear hot! I WILL get this down!!

Delicious! Easy to prepare and cook.

It is very good. Family liked it, and it is easy to make.

The recipe was easy to follow.   I enjoy cooking Chinese food at home  it   very  nutritious.    MOO GOO GAI PAN is one of my favorite food when ordering take -out Chinese food and today I  made this for dinner so yummy and delicious .  Thanks ! deven  Edna Gibbs from the Bronx

Didn't like the sauce.

I've made this twice and love it! it's already my husband's favorite, and even my picky 8 year old ate it up.

1st time there was hardly enough sauce.
Quadruple the sauce mixture was a little to sweet so next time only 3 tablespoons of sugar. 
all the work is in the prep

Too sweet. Not enough sauce. Should be more chicken broth, less sugar, and enough sauce you can dip a spoon in if you want.
