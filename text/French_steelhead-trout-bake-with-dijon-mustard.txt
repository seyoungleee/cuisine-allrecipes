I really liked this quick, zesty dish. I had all the ingredients in the house, whipped it together and had a healthy meal. I love that it doesn't require butter or oil to have a great flavor. I used it on a combination of salmon, pollack, and flounder. I had to sub the dijon mustard for Cleveland stadium mustard, which is on the spicier side, with good results.

This fish was excellent but the topper was nothing special. I did not have lemon or lemon pepper.. plus I added a tablespoon of Mayonnaise because of everyone saying how overpowering the dijon was. I would have probably went up to a 4 with the addition of lemon.

I don’t bake it any other way. Always fantastic

I followed the recipe exactly. My husband stated, “You out did yourself with this meal.”

I don't usually buy steelhead, as most of it is farm-raised, but this is an easy, delicious recipe.

Not complicated, easy way to bake steelhead trout, the final product, Delicious!

Amazing Dish, will definitely make this again.This Recipe Is A Keeper

Didn't have lemon pepper. Used white pepper and lemon zest, otherwise followed recipe. This fish is better more simply dressed.

This was definitely easy to make and was flavorful. I don't like food too lemony, so I left out the lemon, figuring the lemon pepper was enough. I agree that the mustard isn't overpowering, giving it just enough flavor.

Jan 2022 - my first time ever cooking trout and this was very nice, not overpowering and hubby and daughter liked it!  Was easy to prepare and there are no leftovers to speak of!  Anxious to try other trout recipes from here on the pieces now in the freezer!  Thx!

Lovely recipe. I substituted deli style mustard for dijon and added a tablespoon of mayonnaise for added heft to the sauce/glaze mix, and it was perfect. Will be making it again.
