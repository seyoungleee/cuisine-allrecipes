This was without a doubt the best pimento cheese I've ever had!  I omitted the jalapenos, and bumped up the cayenne a bit since I like my pimento cheese with a bit of a bite to it.  Other than that, this recipe is flawless.  Thank you so much for sharing!

All pimento cheese recipes apparently aren't equal.  I definitely didn't like the cream cheese in it at all.  The garlic was out of place as well.  I'll keep trying other recipes, this is not what I was hoping for.

Served this as a pre-Thanksgiving dinner appetisizer.   Everyone loved it and several asked for the recipe.

I followed this recipe to a T .. we couldn't eat it ..   what a waste of time and ingredients .  ( I even tried to doctor it up so it wouldn't go to waste .. we still couldn't eat it . Awful !!! )

Easy and excellent!

I love pimento cheese spread.  I may not be a purist, but I know what I like, and I like this recipe.  It's smooth, rich, with the right hint of spiciness.  My jalapeños were super hot, so I only used half of one.  I also used chipotle powder instead of cayenne because I wanted a hint of smokiness.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing.   This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

Made the recipe and added Jeff's Garden tamed diced jalapeños. Outstanding flavor but not too hot.

The recipe was very easy and was very tasty.  I did not have pimentos so I used a 4 oz can of diced green chiles.  It was still very good (though, no doubt, tasted much different than with pimentos).  I also softened the cream cheese in the microwave.

I omitted the jalapeno and cayenne but used 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika. It was absolutely yummy.

Made it according to recipe in a mixer, perfect!

❤️❤️❤️ this recipe!
