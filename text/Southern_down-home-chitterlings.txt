This recipe is fine, but I would bring to a boil, drain, add water again, and then add your onions, red pepper, and garlic.  If you don't do this, you will have fat on top to deal with.

chitlins themselves are wonderful i cleaned some last night and am cooking them NOW!but 10 pounds of chitlins is not enough for 10 people because the shrink really bad when you cook them,so to feed 10 people you will need 20 lbs cleaned chitlins.and in GA after we boil them we put them in spider(skillet)with a little grease and fry them and that believe it our not draws some of the grease out of them!

I bring my Chitterlings to a 2- 3 minute boil pour that water off.Wash my pot and wash my Chitterlings thoroughly bring to another boil if this water is clear now let's cook add seasons later.

Easy enough ðŸ‘Œ

The biggest part is the cleaning.  I normally buy the Aunt Bessie, Uncle Lou's, or Smithfield Queenella brands.  They are usually super cleaned already right out of the package.  However, I do clean again for myself.  Remember it is not who cooked them, but rather who cleaned them.  Recipe is good, I do add a large potato which cuts down on the smell considerably.  Cooking in a quick pot also cut down on the smell.

My 2nd time using this recipe. It was delicious!!

Great recipe!!!  Exactly how I would recommend seasoning them. I do boil Twice and dump the water before adding the seasoning. I skip all that cleaning by just buying Aunt Bessie's hand cleaned chitlins. Takes out all of the really hard work when it comes to cleaning them.

Loved them!

They were delicious!!!

Follow the ingredients you can't go wrong so tender in full of flavor.

Very tastey I will be using this recipe every time.
