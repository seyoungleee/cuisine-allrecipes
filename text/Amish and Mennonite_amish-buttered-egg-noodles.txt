I use this recipe regularly and love the flavor!  Recently, I made this with beef broth to serve with Boeuf Bourguignon.  Delicious! And so easy!

Had this for dinner last night. Very good but would reduce sodium by using lower sodium chicken broth and bouillon.

I had my doubts ..I added a pinch of crushed red peppers and cracked pepper...it was amazing. I'll be making it again and sharing. You go Amish cooks.

Made this the other night and it blew me away. I never would have thought to prepare egg noodles this way. This is the only way I will make them from now on.

I have never fixed noodles like this before.  The pasta actually gets tender but absorbs the chicken flavor, very tasty.  I'll be making these often.

Good recipe. Enjoyed the noodles. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent noodles.  I did not premelt the butter and they were still great.

The noodles come out perfectly and are quite delicious.

3.11.20  I stirred the noodles three times during the 30 minutes, but some of them were not done at completion.  I just added a bit more broth and bouillon, turned the heat back on, and then let them sit for about another 10 minutes.  I used No YolksÂ® noodles, so maybe the type of noodle I used had something to do with it.  Regardless, they ended up all being cooked and were very, very good!
