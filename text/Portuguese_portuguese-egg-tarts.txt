My fiance has been begging me to make these ever since he tried them in Hong Kong so I was so excited when I found this recipe!  I used a roll of pillsbury pie crust cut into tart size circles, I got about six crusts out of one roll.  I added about a teaspoon of vanilla instead of just three drops.  The filling only made enough for six tarts for me, but that's okay, it probably would have made more had I used jumbo sized eggs.  I baked them for a full 20 minutes and they were great!  My fiance said they were just like the ones from Hong Kong!

Real portuguese egg tarts have puff pastry shells, so I cut circules out of a sheet of puff pastry and lined my tart molds with that. I used 1/4 cup of sugar and the filling was quite sweet enough. Also used all half and half instead of a combo of heavy cream and milk. The filling is creamy and delicious, but mine were over done at 15mins. 13mins might have been fine. Next time, I might just bake the puff pastry shells first, let cool, then pour in the filling and bake till the filling is done. Otherwise, the tart shells didn't brown very much.

Can these be made in advance and frozen??

I also used puff pastry and found that it didn't cook all the way through. By the time the filling had browned nicely the puff pastry was still doughy. Next time I'm going to cook the pastry for a few minutes first then put in the filling and finish the bake. I followed everything else exactly and it tasted great! Will definitely try again.

you can make them with phyllo dough too! :)
