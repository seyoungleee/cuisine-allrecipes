This was amazing! Everyone including the 6yo was going back for more. I am out of gram marsala so I subbed in pumpkin pie spice and a little extra curry. Also missing celery but added a little seed and bouillon with msg.  I went heavy on the tamarind using a block of pressed pulp and it added a nice acidity. Anyway, it's a soup so lots of room to play around but I got pretty darn close. Thanks for turning me on to this one! The naan was a perfect pairing to make a full meal for 4 big eaters with leftovers

Fabulous warming soup for a winters evening. Took longer than I expected to make (Iâ€™m a slow cutter) but cannot fault the final result

Fantastic soup. Full of flavor and comfort.

I didn't do any toppings. Didn't need any! So good!

Delicious soup, lots of prep work,  but worth it.  I didn't have Tamarind paste or coconut cream, so substituted Worcester Sauce and coconut milk.  Perfect blend of spice and sweet.  Another great Chef John recipe.

I made this soup over the weekend when it was below 0. My husband loved it! Kids ate it and liked it but wanted more chicken. I told them it was a soup and not a stew! Don't skip the apple. Another winning recipe from Chef John! thank you

Excellent as written, I only made one substitution based on what I had on hand (lime juice instead of the tamarind paste). Very hearty and filling soup for winter! - Jan '23

We liked this soup. I had a green apple that was not tart so added lemon juice at the end. Otherwise I  followed explicit directions. A nice change

This was so good, all the family loved it!!Definitely going to make again

I made it according to recipe, but substituted parsley for cilantro.  Fantastic and will make it again.
