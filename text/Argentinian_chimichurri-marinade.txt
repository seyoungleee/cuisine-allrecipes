Made as written and this turned out pretty good. I honesty thought the anchovies would make this too salty but they did not. I used this to both marinate the steaks in and also reserved some for dipping the steaks in after they were cooked. I do think this could have used more vinegar but other than that I wouldn't make any changes next time.
