This was delicious! My first time using fish and oyster sauce though... I think next time I make this I might reduce the fish and oyster sauce by half, but the rest of the recipe was spot on! I used serano peppers since I can't handle super hot and it worked out well for me but was still spicy enough for my heat loving husband. I will definitely be making this agian. We loved this dish!

What did I do wrong?! I followed the recipe word for word, made absolutely no substitutes, and the juices from the chicken totally took over the dish and ruined it. The oyster-fish sauce never thickened or caramelized leaving the chicken extremely bland.

Amazing. I seasoned the chicken with accent and five-Asian-spices after I poured off some of the liquid. Before adding all the sauce I sprinkled some corn starch on the chicken and then added the sauce to thicken. I was able to find holy basil at the Asian market. Fried an egg and surprise...

Love this recipe! Very close to a dish at my favorite Thai restaurant. I will try using slightly less sugar next time. I used corn starch to thicken the sauce.

I doubled the recipe and it was great. I didn't buy enough basil though. I added zucchini too. Next time, I'll add red bell peppers.

I really enjoyed this. The basil adds a great kiss of freshness that pairs nicely with the Thai chilies.

I added green beans and red bell peppers. It was great!

Really good but slightly wet, I did replace chicken with turkey to make it abit leaner so maybe this is why. Recommend adding an egg. Spice level perfect!

Very nice grandsons loved this dish

This was terrific! My Thai basil is going crazy, so I’m always looking for recipe’s that use it. Plus, I have a lot of Thai chilies on hand. This one is a definite keeper.

All I can say is WoW!I recently bought an indoor herb garden that came with Thai basil. I wanted to use it because it was going crazy. Thai basil truly has such a unique flavor.
