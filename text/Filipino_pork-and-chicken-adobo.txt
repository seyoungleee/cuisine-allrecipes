I'm part Filipino and this recipe needs several changes. It's an easy dish to prepare and cooks in under an hour. For pork adobo, I usually use pork loin steaks, sliced or not. Brown pork in a skillet on medium high heat til nearly done. I've never needed oil to brown the meat. In a small bowl, mix 1/3 cup soy sauce, 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar and 1 2/3 cups water. Pour over browned meat. Season generously with garlic powder or granulated garlic. Add 2 bay leaves to the sauce. Cook uncovered on medium to medium high heat. The sauce will cook at a slow steady boil, and the flavor will absorb into the meat. You can save a little sauce or let the sauce evaporate.  I usually save a little sauce for the meat and steamed white rice. No need to use rub on meat. Do not add salt or pepper - it will be TOO salty! And no need to marinate. Chicken adobo is another recipe. Prepared correctly, adobo is a 5 star recipe! Family and friends devour it!

Too salty really. I am Filipino and this is something that might help everyone... dont knock it till you taste it because it will be good... 
-- same amounts of pork and chicken
-- mix the ratio of vinegar and soy with 1:1 meaning one cup soy one cup vinegar
-- do not crack the bay leaf... just put two whole bay leaves with pepper corn in it...
-- now here's the kicker... with all the ingredients together with 2 cloves of smashed garlic, soy, vinegar, the pepper and the bay leaf, add a tea spoon of Worcestershire on it... then shove it all into a pressure cooker
-- cook for 20 minutes and take it out... drain the meat from the sauce.. pick up the oil residue and put in a frying pan. Fry all the meats (Pork and Chicken) till tender and dry... Serve in a deep sauce pan and pour all the Sauce... This will taste great

Here's what I did.  I added all the ingredients to a crock pot (minus the oil). I cut up chicken and pork in larger than bite size pieces and cooked on low for 6 hours. 20 minutes before serving, I made a delicious veggie Pancit and using a strainer spoon, dished the protein on top of the pancit.  You can add the sauce to the pancit but because my pancit is so good, I didn't need to. Anyway, the chicken and pork turned out amazing. And maybe because I cooked it this way, it wasn't as salty as everyone else's review.

We did not care for this recipe. My kids wouldn't even touch it and my children enjoy many, many different ethnic cuisines.
