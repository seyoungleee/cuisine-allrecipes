This is one of the best Ginger dressings I have ever tasted.  The only 2 things I do differently are add 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar and use a grinding bowl instead of mincing the ginger.  Grinding it makes it more pasty and juicy.

If I have to give this a star, it can only be 1!  It was horrible!!  I LOVE japanese restaurants and been to a few in my time and NONE of them serve a dressing that even "looks" like this one.  What a waste of good olive oil!  Hate to be so harsh, but this is NOT your typical japanese salad dressing!!  I would say, if you were going to do this, that you could follow the directions for the spice mixture, but mix it with mayo instead of olive oil.  I am half-tempted to try it that way myself, because it tasted fine before the olive oil was added.  Just a thought for those of you who like to experiment!

so good

It was easy and good,  better than spending $7 on a small bottle

It was very good!!

My husband and I didn't care for this as a salad dressing. So I wouldn't waste what was already made, I decided to try the leftover as a marinade. We love to use it that way on chicken and sometimes shrimp.

I added some  sesamy seads and It turned out pretty good

Its really good. I'm going to add a bit more honey next time.

This is absolutely delicious.

This was very good. I gave it 4 stars because I followed the other recommendations and added rice and apple cider vinegar and instead of sugar I added a touch more honey.

This is an excellent dressing I used it on a finger cilantro coleslaw
