Yum! They came out perfectly - and rose very nicely. I could see adding a little more Grand Marnier and orange zest next time for a more pronounced flavor, but it was a light, airy, subtle and absolutely delicious desert. :)

Congrats to the chef! This recipe never fails and it's easy and extraordinary effective.  After a 1000 failures with other recipes worth this recipe I am the queen of the Soufles! Thanks with all my heart.

I doubled recipe, followed directions, especially noting the tips via video, made the Creme Anglaise(divine) and the best part, I held them in refrigerator for 3hours and baked them and they were perfect!

I’ve made it many times now and it produces consistently good results.

First time trying a soufflé.  My meringue was not as white or thick as the video. But it was very good. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious! I also made the Creme Anglaise which just put it over the top. The recipe makes large souffles though - next time I think I will divide it into 4 smaller ramekins and watch the time to cook them.

Very easy, will make again!

I poured a Tablespoon of creme
anglaise in the middle. This was incredible.

Delicious!  Simple, easy to follow recipe.  I did bring out the hand mixer for the eggs white...didn’t have the time or patience to whip by hand to stage they needed to be.  Prepared the custard and refrigerated it along with the separated egg whites and completed the process as instructed after dinner.  Also made the Creme Anglaise sauce earlier in the day.  Will definitely make again!

That was Amazing!!!
