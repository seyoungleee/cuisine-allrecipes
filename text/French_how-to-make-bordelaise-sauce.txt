Foolproof and AMAZING. I actually forgot about the sauce while the wine was reducing, it went down to nothing and I thought the sauce was ruined. Figured I'd pour the stock in anyway (I used chicken stock since I didn't have veal stock) and just see what happened...it still tasted unbelievable. 

Poured this sauce over a broiled Rib-eye -- one of the best meals I've had in ages, restaurants included. 

Also -- I only had 1 shallot but I put in the same amount of liquid and let it reduce a lot. It was still quite good.

The only change I made was halving it.  I ended up with about 2 oz.  Eh. Won't make it again

Another great recipe , though I have never seen veal broth in a store ( assuming home made from veal ) I used a beef broth on our medium rare beef tenderloins. My wife said it was restaurant quality , I also was quite impressed. Thank you for sharing.

I used a caramelized onion bouillon paste (about 2 tbsp), 8 oz beef bone broth, 1 cup water, 1+ cup good red wine, and half a stick of butter.

Reduced by 2/3.  Could not have been easier or more delicious!

Used beef broth.  delicious sauce.  Was a hit during dinner with friends.

I used  Knorr's Demi glac√©  instead of veal stock. Had a dinner party of 10 and everyone loved it on grilled Chateaubriand.

This sauce is so good, it will make you swoon.  Quite a few steps but so worth it.
