Recipe is very good, but I felt like there was something missing....needs some sort of  sauce.

Turn out really great added some Nu potatoes, corn onions green pepper with spanish rice it was delicious I definitely save this one for next time

Great recipe. Only change was I left out the cilantro. If in a hurry, just use store bought orange juice and lime. "Store bought is fine" said a noted cook.

I was excited about the idea of having a new pork recipe other than carnitas and this one was pretty good but I don't think it was spectacular especially considering all the work you put into prepping the marinade. I served it with mexican style pinto beans and rice. I'm not sure I would go through all the trouble again to juice and zest the fruits.

I had a great outcome. The only modification I made was to use sour orange juice (naranja agria). Next time I will cut the juice mixture with a cup or so of water and see how that turns out.

This was delicious!  My family raved about it for weeks.  It cooked faster than the recommended 7 to 8 hours(about 6) so I did not finish in the oven so not to dry it out.  I added chopped green onion in the marinade.   I give this 10 out of 5 stars! Enjoy.

We enjoyed the combination of flavors.  Meat was too tender to slice well, so we shredded it.
It was very time consuming.

I used pork loin instead (all I had) and cooked it in insta pot on low pressure cook for hour and a half, as I was camping I put it on the grill over fire to get the charring. while pork was resting I reduced some of the sauce and finished with butter to put over the pork like a thin gravy.

We used the sauces from the crockpot as a dipping sauce and poured some over the rice. Excellent.

Very good. No changes.
