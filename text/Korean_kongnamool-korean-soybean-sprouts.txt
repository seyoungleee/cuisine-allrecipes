I used soy bean sprouts (instead of mung bean). I enjoy the large bean on the tip for added texture and what I think is a much better flavor (somewhat sweet). I am a huge sesame oil fan but if you are watching calories you can use an 1/8 cup instead of the 1/4 cup and it still has plenty of sesame flavor. I blanch the beans for a minute or two. I skip the vinegar.  I don't care for it in this recipe as I do other Korean recipes.  My husband is Korean and he thought this recipe was delicious!  My Korean mother in law is an amazing cook and I like this recipe better than hers.  Please don't tell.

I WILL make this again because I am really about exploring Korean food lately.   However, me and another foodie tasted it and we both agreed - "Needs something". . .I think the ratio of sesame oil to vinegar is off  - way too much oil and too little rice vinegar.   Even with the soy sauce in there, it may need some salt too, to taste.   I was excited to use Korean red pepper flake for something other than my kimchi.

So good! Once I take one bite I want to finish the whole bowl!

Easy to make!

Reminds me of my father in laws recipe, thank you!

I tried  it  for  the  first  time but  unfortunately 16 seconds is  not  enough to cook  the soybean  spouts.  The  smell and  taste of uncooked sprout lingered so  I started  reading  other  blogs. It  can cook  from  4-7 min and  it  should  be  covered. Will  learn from  this and cook the  sprouts  longer  next  time.

It tasted so good. I didn’t have any Korean pepper flakes so I used 1 tbsp of regular ground red pepper

I usually add a little salt to taste.

One of our favs

So easy, delicious and healthy.  I added hot chili peppers to mine.  My mom used to make this all the time growing up.

I couldn’t find Korean chili powder so I substituted “nanami togarashi” and I only added a teaspoon because I don’t like things too spicy. I also added more sesame oil because my family loved it and it came out great!
