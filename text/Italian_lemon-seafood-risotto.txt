good and refreshing flavor.  Hubby found it a little too sour, so next time I'll only use about half the lemon juice.  Also didn't use scallop, which I think would've given it a more complex flavor.

Did not like this at all. Was really excited to make it. Followed the directions to the T and came our boring and not enough flavor.

Delicious I followed it to the tee.

I added the warmed liquid 1/2 c at a time and stirred frequently.  It was delicious!!

This is a very delicious recipe and I have made it several times

This was a great dish!  Afterwards we thought it could use More Lemon. We also 1/2 an onion and frozen peas that were defrosted in the microwave. We did toss in mussel meat, which we wouldn’t do again. Perfectly balanced as written

So I tweeted it a bit.  I used 1/4 cup of wine and a combination of seafood stock and vegetable broth.  I didn’t add snow peas because my husband is not a fan and I used a whole pound of both scallops and shrimp!

I followed 2 pieces of advice from the other reviewers.  I did not add the whole amount of lemon at once, tasting to see if it needed more.  We added half and then just a little more.  We also did break up the amount of broth and wine to 4 segments, as advised.  Turned out great.

delicious

Next time I will add a little sea salt to it, otherwise it was a great dish!

Did not need to make any modifications or changes as the recipe was very delicious just the way it was presented.
