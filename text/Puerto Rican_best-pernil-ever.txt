I rubbed dijon mustard over it before adding the spice rub and I substituted the wine for about a cup of apple cider vinegar. Only because I didn't have the wine on hand.

This was OK, not as flavorful as I had hoped.

I made the roast following the directions and it had a fantastic flavor.  Even my 90 year old dad liked it and gave it thumbs up.

I make this ALL the time - do look wonderful! I like to add a dozen roughly chopped tomatillos too.
