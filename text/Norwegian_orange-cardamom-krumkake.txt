WOW this is not your traditional krumkake.  Great bold flavor.  My electric iron took 20 to 30 seconds to cook.  We definitely liked the pale ones best.  I got 36 out of recipe.  This will be a new tradition in our household.

I loved the spiced favors for this krumkaka.  I prefer a paper thin cookie so I added a 1/4 cup of hot water to the batter and it was perfect.

Very good. Nice refreshing flavor.

Thank you for this version of Krumkake. I was looking for something with cardamom and was so pleased to find this. I left out the orange peel because I didn't have any, but that just helped to make the spice stand out. I used my grandmother's cast iron krumkake iron.

These taste more spicy a few days later.  We enjoyed them and I'm now working on just the right filling to go with the flavors.  I used a pizzele iron

Great tasting cookies!  I used a mini pizzelle iron, and found that I had a hard time shaping these into anything but flat cookies.  I used coriander instead of cardamom, and love the flavor!  Thanks for the recipe!

I would have rated this a 3, but my husband couldn't stop eating them, and my coworkers really enjoyed them.  Not to mention I'm sure this is a much more interesting flavor than the original Krumkake.  It was a bit heavy on the orange and cardamom, I'd suggest reducing those amounts if you don't want the flavors too strong.

This recipe makes a delicious spiced cookie that everyone liked when I brought them to work.  I omitted the orange zest but they tasted fine without it.  They came out light and crisp!
