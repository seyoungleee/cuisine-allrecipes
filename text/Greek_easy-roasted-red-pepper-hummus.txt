Excellent recipe.  I hesitated to purchase the huge jar of tahini at $5+, but now have confidence that it will get used up just from this recipe alone.  I only added about 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, and it's perfect.  By the way, garbanzo beans and chickpeas are the same thing.

This recipe just did not workl.  WAY too much lemon, WAY too much tahini.

There isn't a more simple recipe!  I've made it several times and it's now my "go to" recipe!  I did add cumin and crushed red pepper to it.

Perfect blend.  I roasted the bell pepper on the gas range and that made a difference to the flavor.  Fresh lemon and garlic.... this is a keeper.  Will make this a lot.

This was an easy recipe to make, however, I'm not quite thrilled with the taste.  I always follow a recipe the first time and feel there was too much of a garlic and lemon taste.  I will make it again, though will definitely alter the amounts of garlic and lemon.

Very good. Really enjoy this recipe. Did add some EVOO to smooth texture out a bit. Not sure why all hummus recipes I've come across don't have olive oil as being one of the ingredients. Always have used it when making hummus; the mixture is less lumpy and not so pasty-tasting. Just our preference.

Excellent recipe

Absolutely love this recipe!!!
