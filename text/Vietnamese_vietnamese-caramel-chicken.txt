OMG is this good!!! And it's easy! Tastes just like take-out that we all love so much but can never duplicate at home!  Note, you gotta love fish sauce to like this. There's definitely that offputting fish sauce smell when the chicken is marinating, but that goes away once cooked and served.   I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and they were so tender. I ended up simmering the chicken for 10 mins after adding the sauce. I served this over jasmine rice. Keeper!

It was really good!
