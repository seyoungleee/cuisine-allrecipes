Great recipe! First time I made it, I didn't share and ate it all by myself -- just delicious. 5 stars. The second time I made it, I had to share with my wife! I am glad I did because she asks for it to be made more often!

We have adapted it to our preferences as follows:
- Use one full onion
- Use one full red pepper
- Substitute 1/4 tsp of Ground Thai Chili for the 1/2 tsp Ground Pepper. Or use 1/2 tsp ground cayenne pepper.
- Omit the rice noodles and add a 3rd chicken breast.
- Use shredded chicken (start poaching before prepping the vegetables, shred and add it to the soup as it is coming to a boil)

A very tasty, quick and easy recipe! As written it is very mild so you will need to add spice if you’re looking for a kick.

A really great idea and starting point.However I;-halved the amount of chicken and noodles called for (which was kinda too much to begin with IMO),-subbed the 1/2 red pepper for a whole red pepper and a whole green pepper in addition,-also did the same with the onion and a red onion,-and added spinach and an additional tbsp of red curry paste.After cooking it I put it straight into the fridge and leave it for a day to give the curry time to permeate and improve with flavor. From my experience curry only gets better the day after and I'd say that holds true here. I'd rather wait and have the whole batch improved rather than eat some the day of and not have it be as good.With these modifications/additions this has become one of my favorite meals that I make regularly and have yet to get tired of it after a couple months making it apx. every week and a 1/2 so far.Highly recommend going the more veggies, less meat/noodles route I went as it is probably healthier and every bit as tasty.

Making this now!House smells amazingThe taste is very enjoyableI will be making this again!Thank you for the recipe!

So easy and so amazing!  Made it for myself and my picky husband ended up inhaling it.  Only changes I made was roasting a chicken and shredding the meat, adding more red curry paste, and adding a bit of fish sauce.  Making another batch tonight!

The fresh basil is not included in the ingredients list for the recipe. Fresh basil is a must! This is a great recipe because it is simple and quick to throw together. Savory and delicious!

6.8.22  Although we liked this well enough, I still think there was something missing.  Maybe add a bit of fish sauce, ginger paste, or lemongrass paste.  I had no rice noodles on hand, so I used spaghetti, otherwise, followed the recipe.  You’ll have to adjust the spiciness with the red curry paste; I added a bit more (personal taste).   If you’re a cilantro eater, I would highly recommend adding some chopped cilantro as a garnish, since that adds another layer of flavor.  Simply said, it’s pretty good, but I think could be improved to a 5-star recipe with the addition of a few additional flavors.

I used low sodium chicken broth and ground turkey instead of chicken, it turned out very good!

I've made this a number of times and loved it. Today I made it with my brother and his wife. We added a lb of uncooked shrimp and a lb of uncooked scallops at the same time as the noodles. Topped it off with fresh cilantro and served it immediately.  Fantastic. Try it.
