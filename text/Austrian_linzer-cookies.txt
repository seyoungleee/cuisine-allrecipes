I had a great time searching for a Linzer Cookie recipe, as I love the true nutty, lemony flavor and chewy texture of Linzertorte.  This recipe really delivers and being a bar cookie saved me lots of time and effort in making individual rolled cookies.  I had a difficult time handling the lattice crust on top, however. My strips kept falling apart.  But overall this was an awesome treat.

I made this using raspberry jam for the filling. I mixed 1 1/2 Tbsp milk into the egg white for the glaze, mixing it with a fork; this makes it easier to brush on with a pastry brush while still giving a nice glaze to the dough. Using turbinado sugar for sprinkling on the dough (under glaze ingredients) bakes up well and adds a nice texture. Baking time was longer than suggested- about 23-25 minutes at 350 degrees.

Delish!!! I added sugar to the recipe!
