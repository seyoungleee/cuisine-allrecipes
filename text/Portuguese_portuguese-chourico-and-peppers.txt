As far as Chourico and Peppers recipes go this is great!  Being part portuguese it's almost a staple at any family function.  I gave it 4 stars only because I find green peppers to be VERY overwhelming in this recipe.  I made it with red peppers and it was perfect!

I used a Shiraz because I heard that when adding wine to a recipe, you should only use wine that you would drink.  I also substituted the green peppers for red peppers. I found this dish made the house smell amazing, however taste wise, it was  too sweet and I thought all that cooking time was not needed.

Looks good but there's a typo in your first ingredient. 
(I know it's a point people will fight over but I don't mind when someone adds a pinch of cinnamon.)

I added some julienned Habanero and Scorpion Peppers.

I used Portuguese linguisa  rather than the hotter chourico.  Because I wanted to use it for sandwiches, I  used one can of tomato sauce and omitted the tomato paste, water and wine.  Perfect consistency for sandwiches!

Very watery!  I followed the directions to a tee and it was just liquid.  I don't know.  I did not like the consistency,  but good flavor...for what it's worth.

Used fresh Sausage and it was awesome- very spicy but awesome. Had to add a bit of sour cream and some cheese for my 10 yr old to be able to eat it but my husband and I really enjoyed it. I think I might do 1 green and 1red pepper next time to maybe sweeten it up.

The recipe called for chorizo, which is completely different from Portuguese chorico. If made with chorico, it is spot on.  I do not like chorizo, it is differently spiced and rather crumbly

I made the big mistake of  believing I could get the same grinder fillings like what I enjoy in Fall River, MA, at Marcucci's on Bedford St. The tomato paste made the flavor "ketchupy".

It came out like mush.  Almost like a meat spread. Maybe better with sliced meat instead of crumbled.

Tastes like growing up in Massachusetts; like home. Thank you!
