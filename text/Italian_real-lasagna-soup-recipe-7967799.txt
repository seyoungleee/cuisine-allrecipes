I suggest you reduce the water by 1/2  to create a thicker, more flavorful broth for the soup.

My new favorite soup! I followed the recipe as is except I didnâ€™t add the water, so it would be a thicker soup. I made the soup base on a Sunday because my weekdays are busy. On the day we were to have it, I just cooked the lasagna noodles, following the recipe instructions. Heated the soup and had it simmering while I prepared the pasta, then put it all together. My family loved it! The cheeses in the bowl were perfection. I would eat this every day if I could.  lol

Scrumptious!  Another keeper.  The noodle prep was worth the effort.  My dish was more of a stew than a soup so next time, I will add more liquid.

Whole family loved it.  Made as is, turned out wonderful

The noodle cooking process of a start cook in water and then oven crisping them was quite good. I know I don't like to use tomato paste, it dulls the flavor to me, so I added a bit of brown sugar instead. Also, I don't get using chicken broth with beef/pork dishes, so I used beef broth that I made previously. I prefer this soup over traditional lasagna. Lasagna is so rich with all the cheese and is much easier to control with the soup. This recipe goes in the favorites pile!

This is delicious! I made it exactly as written.  This is a keeper for me ðŸ˜‹

Super good made with no changes...can't wait to try second day!

This soup is amazing! I made it as written (including baking the noodles and the optional crushed red pepper) with one addition:  after a test taste I added a  tablespoonful of brown sugar.  I think I like this better than actual lasagna.   And bonus: itâ€™s a little easier than lasagna too!!!

I would eliminate the extra salt! Otherwise best soup Iâ€™ve ever had

Easy, and really delicious!
