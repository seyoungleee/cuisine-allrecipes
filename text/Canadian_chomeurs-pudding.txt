I really enjoyed this recipe. As a Quebecer I must say it was authentic.  Simple, tasty, quick and it reminds me of home

As a French Canadian, I've eaten this dessert my whole life and it's one of my favorites. I liked the texture of the cake, however I prefer having more syrup in the bottom so that when you dish it up into a bowl, you can top with additional syrup. Still very good though!

Recipe holds up well to user error! Used the wrong size pan and it was flat and a little bit overdone. Still very soft and moist cake with good flavor from the syrup.Next time I will use a smaller pan and see what it's like when cooked correctly. ðŸ˜…

this is the best recepy i ever made!!!!!

Perfect recipe, sure brought back childhood memories ðŸ˜Š

I added cinnamon to my batter and chopped apples to mine tonight. Delicious

It was my first attempt at making this. Was very easy and extremely tasty.

This was a great recipe, super easy and is amazingly good!!

I believe I should have used a deeper dish as the pudding rose and dried out a bit. Still very tasty. The family loved it!

Just like my grandma used to make on the stove. This is easier. Family fsvorite. Good the next day out of the fridge
