This was PHENOMINAL!!! One of the best recipes that I have tried from this site, hands down. Super simple to put together and the flavor was just awesome. I made this exactly as written aside from omitting the red peppers because I didn't have any and adding in a few cloves of whole garlic. I used hot Italian sausage. My little guy wiped his plate clean, and so did we, lol! This is a definate 10 star recipe that I will be making VERY OFTEN! Thanks for sharing. :)

I grew up in a city that was 60 percent Italian and have since moved away...this dish brings me back to what I remember...(though I have yet to find as tasty homemade Italian sausage anywhere here in Colorado) We never had it with the potatoes either but this is a nice 'whole' casserole in the sense that it has your protein, starch and vegetables all in one. I would suggest doing everything the same except just throw the potatoes down in your casserole dish and pop them in the oven for 20 min first and then don't even bother sauteing the veggies - just sautee you sausages whole then slice them and add them with the vegetables. Also, if you want to have this over rice or on a hoggie with cheese, i suggest you just leave out the potatoes since I dunno, potatoes on bread or with rice  just is too much starch and who needs it when it tastes soooo good without?

i pretty much kept the recipe the way it was.....but i did use plant based hot sausage.  still delicious!  i may add some crushed tomato next time.  this is a staple !!!

I just wanted to do something different with some beef sausages I had sitting. Just so happening to have too many green and red capsicums I thought this would be the ticket. I used beef stock and scaled down for serving size but delighted with the result.  I uncovered the baking dish half way to crisp the top up.

It was so good I did add a bit of mince garlic.

Amazing 👏🏼 👏🏼The flavors blend together so well! 😋This recipe has been added to my daily rotation! Try it out. You will not be disappointed.

Absolutely delicious! Made it according to the recipe, with the addition of yellow peppers. Will definitely make again.

I am not a beginner in cooking, but I'm to thr stage to start using some interesting ingredients. The wine in this dish could not be a better combination. I could eat this everyday!!!!!

I liked it, this is one of those recipes you can make to your liking…

My husband loved it! 5 stars 🤩. I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil because I was out. I didn't have any wine so I increased the chicken broth amount. We used apple stuffed sausages from Costco and the flavor was greatly enhanced. Everything came out hot and bubbling. The house continues to smell good hours later. We will definitely be creating this dish again, soon!

I’ve made this dish many times. This is a great recipe as is but I added more liquid the second time I made it. I’ve made it without the white wine where I replaced the wine with additional chicken stock. I’ve also made it using ground beef and it tastes different but just as good. I’ve made it using andouille sausage and creole seasoning instead of Italian and it works well. You can tweak this recipe just about any way you want and it will still be a good meal.
