Perfect with Chef John's Beef Satay!  A tummy treat for an easy afternoon meal.

Came out great (but I am stingy with 5-star reviews). I didn't make it exactly as written as I am on a "No Shopping" challenge. I didn't have the regular cucumbers, shallots or Thai chili. But, I had one large English cucumber, purple onion and gochujang in my fridge. I used the whole cucumber, 1/2 the onion and threw in 3 fresh salad peppers because I had them, all sliced thinly. I used the dressing ingredients as listed but added a heaping teaspoon of gochujang (instead of the Thai pepper), stirring until dissolved. Enjoyed by most the family.

DELICIOUS! Cool, crisp and refreshing salad alternative!  I did alter a bitâ€¦ only used one large cuke and red onion in lieu of shallots.  The brine is PERFECT as is.  I used a seeded and sliced serrano pepper since I couldnt find the other at the store.  Hubby accidentally ate it!   NOT RECOMMENDED!  Haha.  This recipe is a keeper!
