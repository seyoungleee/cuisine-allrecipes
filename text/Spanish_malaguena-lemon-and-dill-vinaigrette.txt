This is excellent!  I have used it to brighten up several recipes lately that lacked flavor, and it made a HUGE difference.  I love that it is full flavored.  That being said, I don't think I want it on my salad every night, but it is perfect to add to pasta, to meat that lacks flavor, to anything that needs flavor!  Thank you very much, Don, because I'll use it on many occasions!

Delicious on a romaine salad with goat cheese (mentioned in another review) and pecans. Great use for the profusion of dill my Aerogarden is generating!

This is delicious exactly as written!  I used it for a spinach salad topped with shrimp and goat cheese. Im very glad I decided to double the recipe!

Love this vinegrette! I will make this again and again. I put it on arugula, chicken, red peppers, goat cheese and pine nuts salad.

Super delicious.  I'd cut back just a bit on the mustard.

I was looking for recipes to use all this dill I had growing in the garden.  I quadrupled the recipe and blended all the ingredients with an immersion blender.  It was very tangy and tasty!  I shouldn't have added salt though.  I forgot there's salt in the Dijon mustard.  I'm just storing it in a jar in the fridge to use as a salad dressing or veggie dip.  Very good!

Delicious!  Exactly what I needed for a cucumber, tomato, and lettuce salad.  I'd happily try it on other dishes too.

Very good vinaigrette.  I used this to dress a salad of arugula beets avocado goat cheese and walnuts. It was fabulous.  I will be using this vinaigrette often

Made it last night using Meyer lemons and LOVED it!  Put it over a salad made of mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, avocado, carrots, red onion, fresh grated parmesan, and lobster.

Excellent!  I made as directed except mixing all ingredients using a small food processor.  Served with grilled shrimp as an alternative to cocktail sauce.  Thanks!
