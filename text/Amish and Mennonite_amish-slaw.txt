I have made this twice now.  First time exactly, second time made some minor changes.  Great either way, but I think I nailed it the second time.
-use red onion for color
-reduce sugar to 3/4 cup
-1/2 cup white vinegar, 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
-add very thinly slices of 1 yellow or orange bell pepper for more added color/flavor
-add 1-2 tablespoons lightly toasted sesame seeds for added crunch

This is just not "THE" cold slaw recipe I'm looking for.  Not bad, but not great either.  I should have cut the sugar by 1/2, we might have liked it better.

White vinegar is harsh and best used for cleaning. Use red wine vinegar or cider vinegar for best flavor. Proceed with the recipe.

I used 1/2 cup of sugar and we thought the sauce flavor was spot on. I used only red cabbage and no onion - hubby said it was missing "something" so I guess I'll add shredded carrots next time! - Oct 2023

We read the reviews and added 1/2 of the sugar. We thought it tasted too acidy so we added the recipe amount, that was perfect! We will make this again and again for sure!

It is probably just my mistake. When I tried to bring sugar, oil and vinegar to a boil the sugar burned.

Just a bit to much sugar other than that i love it

Unimpressive in the extreme.  What do you accomplish by replacing whipped oil with 3 times as much liquid oil?? Turns your slaw into an oil slick

I followed advice of others and cut sugar amount by half and used 1/2 apple cider vinegar & 1/2 white vinegar.  Also, added chopped up green onion with purple (not white)onion, carrot and crisp apple and then sesame seed at the end.  I would suggest options such as a spicy peanut sause, currents, chopped up peanuts....great simple healthy recipe.  Thanks!

I too made minor changes after reading the reviews. I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of the full cup, and copied another review by using 1/2 cup of white vinegar and 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar. Even though I reduced the amount of sugar, I felt that I could have reduced it even more. I added more black pepper and a bit of chili flakes. instead of one head of cabbage, I used half a head of green cabbage and half a head of red.

I only had a small cabbage, so halved the recipe & it was perfect.
