We liked them.  I'm not familiar with traditional beignets, so don't have a comparison.  They came out moist, kind of cakey inside, crunchy outside, medium sweet.  Reminded me of a mini muffin, but with a nice outside crunchiness.  I did increase the vanilla slightly, and I used a mini muffin pan. (Don't have an egg-bite pan)

I made these, followed the instructions. They came out ok, no real taste and definitely not like a traditional beignet. These are more the constancy of a cake than an a fluffy pastry/donut. I will continue my search for a air fryer beignet recipe.

I loved these little nuggets. They had just the right amount of sweetness and couldn’t eat just one. I will definitely make it again.

More cake than beignet. I will add a little more sugar next time. Maybe cinnamon or cardamom. Easy enough.

These actually came up pretty darn close to New Orleans style beignets. I have the big eight quart air fryer so they cooked in 8 minutes first and then 3 minutes on the parchment paper. These were a real hit for Sunday morning brunch.

Very tasty.  However, I only got 6 and they are 1/2 size.  What did I do wrong?

It totally could've been me, but the dough seemed pretty dense. They turned out being crispy on the outside and underdone on the inside. Might try again but I don't know. It was a lot of work for them to not turn out.

Next time I plan to thin the dough out a little more before folding in the egg white.

Tasteless, flavourless, hard Beignets. I followed the recipe twice to the “T” and it was still dry, hard and flavourless. 
Would NOT Recommend this recipe to anyone.

My best friend and I love the beignets at Downtown Disney, and these are a real close second and only 3pt on WW.  
Love them.  Definitely a recipe I will share.

This recipe does not make anything resembling a beignet. Small cakes or muffins perhaps, but certainly not a beignet. Do not waste your time.
