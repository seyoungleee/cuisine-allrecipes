Easy and tasty.  Not the BEST sauteed mushrooms I"ve ever had, but they were good.  I didn't use any steak seasoning.

Just a couple comments.  Four tsp of seasoning for 1 cup of mushrooms is WAY too much.  And unless you really want oregano-sauteed mushrooms, 2 tsp of oregano IMO is WAY too much.  I used baby portobellas and sliced mine instead of chopping for a better presentation.  I mixed up the seasoning but only added about half of it because the mushrooms were getting really "gummy".  I like oregano, but it just overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the mushrooms.  Mushrooms release a lot of liquid and cook quickly, so I have to wonder if you really even need 3 tbsp of fat.

Easy peasy....

This by far is the best mushroom recipe. The first was delicious. This time I added fresh spinach.

It's a new way to spice up your mushrooms and so simple.

Great idea, used as a side dish with blistered tomatoes when serving hamburgers. Husband is watching sugar, and this was perfect! Did not have oregano or steak seasoning, and used diced fresh garlic in addition to the garlic powder. Used a stir fry assortment of mushrooms - good, but I believe I like all oortabellas best as recipe states - hubby wanted to try the assortment. Thanks for the idea to use as a side dish, and I'll make another time for folks with the steak seasoning.

I enjoyed the recipe. It is simple and it tasted great. My only complaint is that it calls for too much oil. I will cut down on the oil, next time. I also added salt and pepper and for taste.

A-1 Steak Sauce, salt and pepper

Just what I needed a snack to keep me going until dinner time, loved it.

Simple recipe, but it turned out wonderful. My daughter who claims she hates mushrooms, actually ate the!
The only problem I had was that I didnâ€™t make enough.

Way too many spices  for the amount of mushrooms.
