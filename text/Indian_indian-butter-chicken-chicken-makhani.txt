This tastes just like what I order in my favorite Indian restaurant. For the most I followed the recipe exactly as written. I made two substitutions because of what I had on hand - nutmeg instead of cardamom and heavy cream instead of half and half and yogurt. I also need a new blender because my old one just wouldn't purée the sauce as well as I would have liked. The flavors were perfect, a little on the spicy side, and hubby agreed that this was a keeper.

my husband & i really loved this - served it with jasmine rice and used some chopped cilantro too - next time i'm  using flat leafed parsley cause that's what's in my garden - use the boneless chicken thighs!

Best recipe I've found yet for Butter Chicken.  It was absolutely perfect.  Added more heat.  So good.

I've been searching for a perfect recipe for butter chicken for years and THIS IS IT*!The spice mix is perfect, the color and taste of the sauce is exactly what I was looking for.* Here is the list of changes I made: I used coconut milk instead of yogurt/cream, I halved the cayenne so my kids can handle it

I've never eaten Indian food because I don't like spicy food.  It always seems like the heat obliterates the other flavors.  This was warmly spicy and delicious.  I ordered the masalas and curry off Amazon.  I sampled each one on its own and decided to decrease the curry to 1 tsp.  I omitted the cumin.  Added about two tbsps extra butter.  It was yummy and filling comfort food.

Easy and delicious recipe!

This recipe is AMAZING Thank you! We loved it so much.

Authentic tasting and good to eat!

I didn’t have any ground cardamom, so I left that out. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a “T”. It was very good! My family agreed that I can now delete the other butter chicken recipes from my recipe box and keep this one! Looking forward to trying it again with the ground cardamom!

Delicious! Would love to try this recipe in pizza form with naan as the crust.
