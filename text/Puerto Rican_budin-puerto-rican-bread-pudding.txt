It took me back home.  I love it!  I added 1/2 tsp of fresh ground ginger and 2 of the little boxes of raisins.

One question. Does the baking pan need to be greased or does this recipe not stick to the pan? Please update if the pan does need to be greased because I made this recipe without greasing my pan.

If you’re gonna give a recipe of PR bread pudding, please put up the right picture image of it. This image is of FLAN not bread pudding.

Great recipe! Thanks.

This recipe was easy to follow and it came out delicious. I made a few changes, used less sugar in the bread pudding and added a few spoons of condensed milk bc I like it creamy. I will definitely be making this often :)

The budin recipe was easy to follow and make. Came out AWESOME!!

EXCELLENT👍👍👍 Deliciously perfect in every way!I made 2 loaves.  Can one of them be frozen???

My family loved it

Delicious.  I used Truvia instead of regular sugar (except for the caramel) and it was to die for.

This recipe is fantastic. It has great flavor and comes together easily. However, I do wish there was a little more explanation and instruction about how to make the caramel for the bottom as that is a bit more advanced. I will be keeping this recipe and making it for the holidays.
