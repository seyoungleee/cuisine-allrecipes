Overall, my family thought it was quite tasty.  Even my picky teenager asked for seconds.

As it is, the recipe makes for a rather bland stuffing.  I ended up adding 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp oregano and doubled the cumin and paprika.

I also added 1/4 cup lemon juice and it really freshened it up.  This recipe fills about 30-36 of the pre-made 4" frozen empanada dough (Goya).

Easy to make, seasoning was a little bland so I spiced it up with extra black pepper. I used both the egg roll wraps and empanadas dough.

Excellent recipe
