If you read through the previous reviews, the 1 constant remark “the bread is sticky” appears.  We added an additional ¾ c flour to our bread machine (using a total of 4 ½ c flour) which did the trick.  What’s the point of using the bread machine if you’re kneading more (in this case A LOT) of extra flour in the end?  Our finished product turned out well.

I'm very experienced with using bread machine recipes, yet I found this bread to be extremely disappointing. The dough turned out like batter and was impossible to shape because it was so sticky. Even working in extra flour was no help. If I'd had extra time, I would have added more flour and more yeast, and put it back through an extra knead and rise cycle. Unfortunately, I didn't have the luxury of time, since I was getting ready for a family holiday function. I'm sure the loaf would have been fine (though perhaps dense) if I'd just poured the batter--um, dough-- into a pan and baked it, but I was really hoping this recipe would yield a loaf I could shape beautifully for our holiday. So in my frustration I threw the dough/batter away. I won't try this recipe again--and this is the first recipe at allrecipes.com that has been so disappointing.

People LOVE this challah! I get rave reviews every time! I use more than 4 cups of flour (probably between 4.5 and 4.75), but otherwise, I follow this to a T!

Easy and turned out tasty! I added 1/2 cup more flour. I have learned to put the salt in first and make sure the yeast is in a small flour circle on top. Thank you for sharing this as it isn't hard for my arthritic hands to do.

Use 515 grams of flour. Then the bread is delicious.Also, I only had active dry yeast at home. I proofed it with 1 tsp of the sugar and 1/4 cup of the water for the recipe. Worked out fine.

This was the EASIEST, prettiest bread I've ever made. And tasty!!

Though it's a long process, the directions were clear and the challah came out great!

This recipe is almost perfect.  Next time I will add another tsp. of sugar.  I may try making it with 3 eggs (plus the egg for the egg wash , making you need 4 eggs total for this recipe.

Just made it!  Wow this is a great recipe. One loaf is half gone and it's been 10 minutes!  I read the reviews and added an extra 1/2 cup of flour.  Otherwise just followed recipe exactly. Great recipe.

Even though the dough its loose.  it came out so puffy and taste amazingly well.Everyone complement it on my shabbat  table.  I will keep it making in mine machine.Observation I cooked inside my machine so I just separate the dough with a spatula not to ruin the teflon.  I suggest if you want braid  it add 1/2 cup flour extra to the recipe or little more until you see a manageable dough.But really the taste of this challah it was superior.

Followed instructions. Didn’t rise had to through out. What a waste of ingredients 👎🏽
