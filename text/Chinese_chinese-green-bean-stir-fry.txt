Very tasty!  I scaled back to 4 servings :-) and used peanut oil.  As I was heating the oil I tossed in about a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to give it some more spice and I ended up omitting the black bean sauce because they looked so good as is I just plain forgot to add it.  Would be good with some toasted sesame seeds sprinkled on near the end, too.

After 30 minutes cooking, the beans were still crunchy! I can't even imagine how long it would take to make 40 servings! Could make this again but would definitely blanch or steam the beans prior to stir-frying them.

Personal Favorite

Simple and Delicious.

Turned out really good  !

Not a bad recipe. Simple to make but, for me, it lacked real zing.

Loved it!  Will for certain be making this again.  Scaled the recipe down to a serving of 5 and added 1/2tsp of red pepper flakes for some added zing and flavour.

Really good! I did not have the black bean  so i used Hoisen and no ginger.  opps and i added pepper flakes. Scaled it back to 6 people

This came out great.

I didn't have the fresh green beans.  I substituted  frozen and followed the recipe.  This recipe was better than the green beans that I usually get at the restaurant.  I will make it again, and again.

Awesome dish, a must do!
