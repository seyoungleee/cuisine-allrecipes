This review is only for the crust.  I used this crust for an authentic empanada crust, and it was spot on!  To mix the dough I first used a fork then my hands the rest of the way, all in the bowl.  There was no need for extra flour since I rolled between wax paper.  My dough didn't become stretchy until after it rested for 15 minutes. 1/4 inch is somewhat thick, so after cutting the circles, roll the dough out a little thinner. I sprinkled paprika over the egg whites, and baked at 350 for 35 minutes

I lived in Chile for 2 years and this dough does NOT taste authentic to me. It was very thick and difficult to roll out. I had to add more lard and milk and it still didn't form a nice dough.  I did not care for the taste at all. I don't recommend this recipe

Very bad recipe. Do not try it. The dough recipe needs to be reviewed and adjusted because exactly as it is posted is NOT an empanada dough. Waste of my time, and my good cheese.

I was an exchange student in Chile this year, these are exactly like the empanadas my nana made! They brought back great memories and did not disappoint :) I don't think they sell queso mantecoso in the US so I used mozzarella cut into chunks which was great. I fried the empanadas...my little brother said it was the best meal he'd ever had!

They taste AMAZING with salsa or cream cheese as a dip...also instead of putting a block of cheese in the middle, I did a Mediterranean twist and did ground chicken, basil, cubed tomatoes and grated cheese instead!!
