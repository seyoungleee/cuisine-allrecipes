Wonderfully moist and flavorful chicken!  True confessions, I did not grill my chicken but spatchcocked and oven roasted it instead.  I used fresh oregano and rosemary from my garden.  I put lemon pepper in with the other herbs and spread this on the chicken and put the lemon juice in the roasting pan with chicken broth, which made a fab sauce to lace over the entrees on the plate.  Restaurant quality in my opinion!

tender, flavorful and delicious!

Been hunting for years. Finally found several for Greek chicken. Now I know where to go.
