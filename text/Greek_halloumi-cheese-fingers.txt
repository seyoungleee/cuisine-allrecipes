Fantastic!!!  I tried this using both a  stainless steel and dark, non-stick pan.  The non-stick worked much better, creating a very delicate and even crisp golden crust.  In stainless steel this took a long time to color and then once it started, the cheese began to burn almost immediately.  My gal pals have added this to the "must haves" for every get together.

6.20.21 Had friends over last night, I served appetizers for dinner, and this one got rave reviews!  Must be eaten fairly soon after it comes out of the skillet, otherwise, it starts to firm up.  But one bite, and itâ€™ll all be gone very quickly.  Good stuff, really enjoyed.

delicious!

Amazing and addicting! If you love flaming saganaki, you'll love this simpler, flame-less version. Tangy, salty and ooey-gooey. I love to eat it with crusty bread. Will definitely make this again!

What the instructions failed to tell you; 

You need a hot pan to get the golden brown. Medium heat may not get you there. We had to turn the pan up! 

Olive oil: Less is more. You really only need a couple drops or you'll boil the cheese and it won't crisp. 

The seasoning is fantastic. Oregano or Italian seasoning and lemon juice sprinkled to taste. 

You're welcome. We used a non stick pan.

delicious

Made no changes. It was tasty.  I had to be patient to get all the pieces nice and brown, but it was worth it. The lemon juice really adds that extra something.

I prepared this tonight per the instruction.  We thought this was really good and made it a keeper.  I did turn up the heat to med-high and flipped them a few times over about 4 minutes and got that great crust.

made this for years !!!!!  killer dish !! do it!!

Good recipe, don't skimp on the lemon.
