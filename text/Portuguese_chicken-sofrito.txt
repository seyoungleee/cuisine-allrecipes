This recipe came together quickly so it’s user friendly for busy lifestyles! I made a few changes only because I didn’t have all of the ingredients in the recipe. I used turkey bacon in place of the chourico sausage and rice vinegar in place of the Red cooking wine. I used a bit more sofrito than called for and a bit less sazon. Despite my tampering, it came out great! I’m on a quest to find some chourico sausage so I can make this again.
