This is an interesting recipe. The filling does not set completely--it is a little gooey, but not runny. A delicate flaky crust forms on the top of the filling after baking, similar to the one on a chess pie, and it cracks attractively if you aren't gentle when removing from the tin. The pastry is probably my favourite part of the tart (but it's all good!) Some tips: Although the recipe did not state to do so, I cut the cream cheese into the flour because that's how I make rugelach. I eyeballed the amount of nuts and put them into the muffin cups before spooning in the filling. After baking, I cooled the tarts in the tin, on a rack for about 10 minutes before taking them out. EDIT: I have since made these with butter-flavoured shortening instead of butter in the crust. Still good!

The consensus at our house was that these were great! The recipe was easy to follow, and the cooking time was perfect. I substituted butter for margarine and raisins for nuts as that is what I had in the house. The only issue I had is my muffin pan sizes. I have what I term mini, medium and large. I started to use the large but quickly realised I needed to use my medium ones.

I love this recipe the only thing that was all little difficult was the filling did not set in 20mins i had to put it back in for another 11 minutes other than that the tarts were vary good i would defiantly made this again
