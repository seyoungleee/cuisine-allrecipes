Could not find black cumin seeds anywhere. I live next to one of the largest Indian merchant areas in New Jersey. No black cumin seeds to be found so I doubled up on the regular cumin seeds. Found the recipe to be a little bland so I added 1/2tsp of cayenne pepper and 1 tsp of curry powder. I used fresh thick cod filets and found them too delicate for the recipe. Next time I will use stripe bass or blackfish, All in all a pleasant flavor.

I have tried the recipe at my home. It was very tasty and yummy. I loved the recipe. Thanks for sharing.

For those who could not find "black cumin" - it's not cumin and is a literal translation of the Bengali or Hindi name. It's sold under the name "kalonji" or "onion seeds" - any Indian grocery store will carry it.
Also it's not accurate to say that only the leftover pieces are used for curry. As a die-hard Bengali with roots in both Bengals, I remember the best curry made out of fresh Katla (Buffalo)/ Rui (Rehu or Carp) and Bhetki. Every slice was used.

Also made this minus the black cumin. Came out wonderful.Flavorful without being 'hot'. If most Indian food is too spicy for you then this would be a good addition to your recipe box.Think I'll try it with salmon next time.
