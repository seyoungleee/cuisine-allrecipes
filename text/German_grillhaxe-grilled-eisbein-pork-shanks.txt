it is so good

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was really delicious. I will definitely make it again. Thank you

Very Good.very tender & moist.Raw shanks are hard to find to begin with.

This turned out fantastic !  Looked just like the photo and the flavor was wonderful.  I think it would be great with Lamb Shanks too.  Will do this one again !

It turned out like I had in Muchen. I have had it twice and it is great. 01-01-2017 Made it again. I can't say enough how good these pork shanks taste. Make them just like the recipe. No changes. Yummy!!!

great as given.  I also used smoked hocks the next time 
I made it and it was not as good.  So, fresh only.
