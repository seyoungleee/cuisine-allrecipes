Wonderful soup and perfect for a cold snowy day!  Made exactly as written and received great reviews from those heading in from the slopes.  Based on personal preference, I reduced the butter down to 2.5 tablespoons of butter - couldn't tell the difference.  Will definitely go into my family's list of favorites!!!

Not bad but not totally to our taste. Still, it's easy and fast to make.

I reduced chicken broth to 4 cups and added lots, lots of ground pepper.

This was so delicious and easy to make. I added garlic, extra mushrooms and switched spices to thyme, oregano, paprika and onion powder. I also used vegetable stock.  Will definitely be adding this to my favorite soup recipes.

I made it according to directions and it was so easy and quick.  From start to finish we were eating it in 30 minutes.  Really delicious soup.

Hello. I added one more leek and less potatoes. Loads of white and Baby Bella's. I used vegtable stock as I am a vegitarian so I needed to adjust the recipe. Loverly!

Fairly good soup.  But a major rant, if your going to make this soup with the original 7 ingredients, make it and give a fair review.  One lady posted that she added another 7 ingredients.  Itâ€™s not even the same soup anymore!  Make your own post with your own recipes!

This soup was fantastic!  Didn't change a thing.  So flavorful, a new favorite at our house.  I used half button mushrooms and half baby bellas and left them in big pieces.  Next time I will make them a little smaller.

Great recipe!  I used truffle salt since they go with the mushrooms. Also added italian seasoning, garlic powder, and oregano as suggested in another review. Definitely, a keeper!

One of my favorites!

The only change to the recipe was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken and to sautee the mushrooms first before adding the carrots and leek. I don't see the need to dirty another pan when it can easily be a one pot meal. Served with bread sticks
