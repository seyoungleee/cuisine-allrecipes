We thought this was very good and would not change a thing.  I was born in Germany and this is very close to authentic.  I would not recommend using any type of seasoned bread crumbs because it will really change the way it should taste with the sauce.  Thanks

I decided to try this as I heard a few people who said they really liked it on here. I had 4 kind of large pork cutlet steaks. So, I just cut them in half, so they would get throughly cooked. I did the full amount of bread crumbs, but about half of them did not get used. I thought the sauteed pork tasted fine without the sauce. I may buy some better quality cutlets and tenderize my own and try it again, just making that meat. I just really did not care for the sauce at all and found it to be way too chunky. And, the canned mushrooms just did not seem to work well in it. I wish I would have used fresh mushrooms in the sauce, that may have helped. I don't know.

My parents are German and I've been many times. This is a fantastic recipe! No changes needed.

Good

Loved the recipe; added a touch of canned milk to stretch the egg, dipped pork in seasoned flour, then in the egg, and double coat with flour mix, grill in butter till done and well browned. Then with the gravy; I don't like cubes - used a teaspoon of dry soup and gravy base - then added a TBSP of Cooking Sherry just before taking off the stove.

Love this recipe as is . Made it many  times  and everyone loves  it. Thanks!

Amazing stuff. Makes me click my heels.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was delicious! I will definitely keep this recipe for Oktoberfest. When I told my friend about it she wanted the recipe, which I gave her. Her husband really enjoyed it, too. It's very easy to make.

I made it with veal vs pork cutlets and Spatzel as a side dish, very good with the sauce.

Yummy!

delicious!  we have this at LEAST once a month.  my picky eater even loves it.
