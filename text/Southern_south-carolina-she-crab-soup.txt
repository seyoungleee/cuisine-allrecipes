I live in Virginia and they serve a She-Crab soup here in the restraunts and this recipe is very close to the ones I have had, but I did add the old bay seasoning and served it with buttered french bread.

Nice recipe.  It should be labeled as Crab bisques as there is not "She Crab" in it.

Absolutely fantastic...and easy!  Like others, I tweaked it a little bit and added more hot sauce and Old Bay. Hubby insisted I add 3 pounds of crabmeat...incredible recipe! Thank you for sharing!

I cut the half n half by half. I used Old Bay in place of salt, and omitted the dill and hot sauce. It was outstanding!

i made it thicker with more crabmeat iam going to try and add 1 can of cream of shrimp soupe

Super easy, super tasty--big chunks of crab, fresh flavorful herbs, no pureeing! Simply delicious!!

Mine did not thicken up, as expected.  Next time I make it, I will add paprika and reduce the amount of half and half, add Old Bay, and more hot sauce for a little more flavor.

As-is, I felt the recipe was a little bland, but it will get the job done. After reading reviews about people adding Old Bay and fish stock, I added some Old Bay and anchovy paste (my store didn’t have fish stock) and it was excellent. Do try the recipe as-is, because there’s nothing wrong with it at all, but have Old Bay on hand.

Wow.  Came out perfect.

I changed the following.

I grated the garlic.
I doubled the Worcestershire and hot sauce.
I did not add the wine.

I also finely chopped crab.

After melting the butter 
I threw everything in the pot at once.

This soup is the best that I have ever had. It’s absolutely perfect! Don’t change a thing. Just enjoy

Super easy to make, and even better tasting than what we used to make in the restaurant I worked in back when I was younger.
