This was a nice change for shrimp. The citrus flavor was very strong for us, I did use fresh squeezed. Maybe using more pepper flakes would help to balance that? I think less cook time for the shrimp as well because it actually starts to cook in the marinade, then sits after cooking while the sauce thickens. I used large Red Argentine, and they were too done in the end. Went well with rice and black beans.

I am so pleased to be the first review for this scrumptious shrimp entr√©e!  Bibi, the tang from the citrus juices is spot on and enhanced by the subtle warmth from the red pepper flakes and cumin.  I kept all ingredients as written, but used only half a pound of shrimp for the two of us. After reducing the marinade/sauce, I threw in the shrimp to warm and served it over jasmine rice. DE-LISH! Thank you, my friend, for a winning recipe!
