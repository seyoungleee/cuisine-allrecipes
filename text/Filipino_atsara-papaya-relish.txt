I just love it with fried fish.Salamat lola.

I made it yesterday. It was a hit. I made some changes like cut down sugar into half and used turmeric instead of ginger.  It turned out perfect. Not bad for the first timer. Thanks Lola.

Reminds me of home. 5 stars. Thank you for sharing .

Ive done it many times already. It turns out really crunchy if you squeeze and drain all that water and salt.  Really good recipe!

I'd make it again. I didn't put in a jar. Just a square glass container with a snap on lid. I kept in the fridge foe a week and it was finest , crunchy, tasty and fresh.

Very easy to prepare!

This is the perfect relish to include in tuna salad.  And I also add some of the pickling brine to the salad.

I just love it with fried fish.Salamat lola.
