For once, I did not improvise anything.  Very flavorful and tender.  I served it with pearl couscous.  Excellent.

Great recipe.  Did not change a thing.  Served over Jasmine rice.Even better the next day!

Why I gave this 5 stars- really flavorful, finally used my saffron and curry, relatively easy dish to make and also healthy. We enjoyed dinner and I will definitely make this again. I followed the recipe other than I did not use a non-stick pan which was fine because when you add the broth it will deglaze the pan.

Super easy and delicious!  Glad I took a chance with my expensive saffron.  Will definitely make again.  This does make a lot of sauce - you could easily add more chicken for a larger crowd.

My husband and I both went back for seconds, so I guess it was a hit. I served with orzo.

Easy, tasty, low-carb, low-calorie dish.
