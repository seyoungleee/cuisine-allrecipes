This is totally delicious.  More of a custard than pudding.  So easy to make with so few ingredients. Highly recommend this recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

Kosher salt is not part of the Puerto Rican cuisine.

Made it for the first time 2 weeks ago. I’m the only one that eats it in my house so I ate it all🤦‍♀️ Once again made me some today and waiting for them to chill. Walmart sells small cups with lids and that what I use. It never sticks to the sides. Love this recipe!!!

I have been making this recipe for quire sometime during christmas time. The tembleque always comes out perfect! 🎄🌲🎄🌲 Thanks fir sharing!

Simple and delicious! If you have a sweet tooth maybe add just an extra tablespoon of sugar.

No changes just kept the recipe going thanks again

I make maizena frequently  in my household. I've learned by trial and error the best way to make maizena is to leave the slurry mix of  milk with the maizena on the side and wait for the milk to come to an almost full boil then pour it in and using a whisk, stir vigorously to break up any lumps. When you mix it all together, you run a chance of creating lumps bc the heat won't be distributed all throughout the milk. Before anyone says it's different than making tembleque, it's really not. Tembleque is firmer bc more of the maizena is used. Use less, it creates a creamy custard made for like breakfast.

Was easy to make and I love my tembleque warm or cold. So Mom and I had a little bit of it while it was warm and now waiting for it to chill and eat away on the chilled part. My Mom who is 83 was born in Puerto Rico and grew up eating tembleque and really enjoyed a taste of the island.

This literally brought tears to my eyes with the first taste (still hot) because it reminded me of my childhood so much! This is a perfect recipe as far as I can tell. Thanks for sharing!

This is by far the best Tembleque I've had. As a proud Puerto Rican woman who enjoys and appreciates the foods of our culture, there is absolutely no room for negative reviews for this recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Next time, I will tweak it and maybe use coconut cream too. The coconut milk doesn’t have much flavor. Plus I used the unsweetened one, so I am sure that made a difference in flavor. I might throw in some vanilla too.
