Just an update from the author of this recipe: I have a bit more experience with sushi-making than I had when I submitted this recipe, and I would change a few things if I could. Since that’s not possible, please note that in my original recipe the rice had too much vinegar, so I now add half the amount of vinegar, sugar, and salt to the sushi rice. Note that Cider vinegar works just fine as a substitute for the rice vinegar in this recipe. Also note that the simmer time on the rice should be reduced to 10 minutes instead 25: any remaining water will be absorbed during the 10 minute hold after that, and the rice will be better (less mushy).

People has never ate sushi enjoyed it.

tons of fun! We did seared tuna rolls and made a wasabi soy dressing for dipping sauce, from the California roll salad on AR. Super important to wash off extra starch on rice 1st so you don't get globby rice. Rinse uncooked rice in cold water till water is clear.
