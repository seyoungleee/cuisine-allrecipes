It does make a good rustic loaf, surprised I don't taste the corn meal as much as I thought it would.

Was wrong proportions of cornmeal to milk.  Didn't use all the cornmeal and doubled the milk.  to make thick sauce.  Then too wet so had to add more flour.  Have made bread often so know what to expect.  Not for a novice

I love cornbread, wanted something different to do using cornmeal. I followed the amounts of milk to cornmeal, but as soon as I put cornmeal in sauce pan, mixture was so thick could hardly stir it. I added more milk but still thick.

Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and easy to make! Although, you have to add a lot more milk to get the liquidity you want to be able to knead it well.
