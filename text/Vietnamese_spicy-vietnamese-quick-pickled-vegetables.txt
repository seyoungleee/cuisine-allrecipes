This is a great baseline recipe.  I opted for half the salt and some soy sauce, plus I added a bit of sesame oil and used 2 Serrano peppers.  I was also too lazy to heat up the brine.  I just stirred it up and poured over the veggie mix.  I may add a touch of fish sauce next time too.  This is exactly what I had in mind and it turned out great.  Thanks a ton for sharing!!
