This was very good!  It was very easy to prepare, and all of the engredients I had on hand.. made it even better.  I sliced my steaks paper thin while they are partially frozen so it's easier to slice.

This was just okay. Kind of discouraging because it was alot of prep work and dirty dishes. Not sure if i'll make again...

Yummy

very simple recipe to follow, I always wanted to make it, tastes just like my lola. -thank you

It was easy to make - and really tasty.  Served with rice and french beans.

The only suggestion I can make is I would cut back a tiny bit on the lemon juice (I had a pretty large lemon - maybe a smaller one would work better) 

Definitely will make it again.

I baked this instead of putting it in oil. It was good but the meat was rally tough.

It was so good

So juicy and delicious

Good recipe, but you need more marinade. After I made more marinade it tasted a little too tangy, so I kept having to adjust the lemon and soy sauce mixture. My fault though...

I put the marinade and onions (after they were cooked) in another pot and thickened the sauce with corn starch. My hubby likes to add it on top of his rice. 

My dad makes this but doesn't add sugar to it at all. Still tasted much like his though.

The dish was too salty, and I love salt.  I would probably not make again, although I appreciated the ingredients were all items found in the typical kitchen.  It just wasn't for me.

I made this today and the whole family loved it. Easy to make yet very delicious!
