This was awesome!!! I did exactly as the recipe stated and my family raved about it.   The only thing that I would specify is when it just coats the spoon you need to take some and put it on a plate and let it cool.  Then you will know the real consistency.

I tried this cause we have had it before but couldnt locate the recipe...it DOESNT thicken ...unlike the recipe I cant find! Simmered for 40 mins and still like water...the other recipe thickened immediately.

This recipe is great for a glaze. My heat was too low so it took longer than 20minutes to reduce. Make sure to simmer on high enough heat to reduce properly.

Always have it on hand in a squeeze bottle in the fridge. Great on everything from grilled meats to caprese salad to vanilla ice cream with fresh summer strawberries. Perfect recipe as is!  Better than any store bought glaze.

Super easy, sweet and tangy.

Delicious, I used brown rice syrup instead of brown sugar as that is what I had on hand.   Came out very good and did thicken as it cooled .

I used honey instead of sugar and it turned out great!

So easy and so good! Eating it on grilled chicken now.

I halved the recipe, and you can see from the picture that the glaze reduced by half after simmering for exactly 20 mins. It coated the back of a spoon. It thickens as it cools.It tastes exactly like I expected it to! It did make the house very vinegar-y smelling even with the oven hood on max and I had to open the door to air it out. Only drawback!

So easy and so delicious! I added a touch of maple syrup to mine!

I love this and am addicted! So far I've made it with honey then brown sugar. Right now I'm going to try pure maple syrup! I have yet to refrigerate my glaze because I don't want to drizzle cold glaze on warm food. I keep it tightly sealed. I use it on fruit like pineapple, mango & plantain I roast in my Ninja Dual Heat oven.
