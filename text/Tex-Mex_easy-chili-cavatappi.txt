Simple, delicious and VERY kid friendly! I did add some chopped green pepper to the onions and because I didn't have quite enough tomato sauce, I added in a can of petite diced tomatoes (undrained). The whole family devoured this! This chili has a nice, mild flavor that is perfect for any pallet (though, I am sure you could easily up the heat factor). I will def be making this quick and easy recipe again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Followed exactly but my kids added cheese and Fritos ;)

Delicious!! The only changes I made were to use kidney beans instead of black beans and some members of my family topped theirs with shredded cheese. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Easy, quick, and good for a kid friendly meal.

Made as written at the request of my husband who was remembering this from his childhood. He said it was perfect. New to me, but decent cold weather comfort food.
