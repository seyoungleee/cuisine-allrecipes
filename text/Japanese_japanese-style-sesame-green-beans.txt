Delicious, pretty and different. I found I needed to cover the pan a few minutes to ensure the beans were cooked crisp-tender before they would turn too brown. I finished these with a dribble of toasted sesame seed oil at the end which really enhanced the flavor, and I  believe this would have been kind of boring without it. These were so good and flavorful that this is one of those rare occasions where the addition of garlic wouldn't necessarily have made this any better.

Substituted plain green beans for Japanese edamame soy beans. However, mine turned out a little salty, so I think I will cut back on the soy sauce for next time.

This is an all to family favorite!

This recipe was so easy and very tasty. With only a few ingredients and minimal prep work, this dish makes a great healthy weeknight side dish. I will definitely make  this again.

It's all right. Easy to make, but not really flavorful.

Favorite way to serve green beans.

A change but can do a lot to change it up if you want or not.  Could add mushrooms, bacon, onion, or leave as is.  The sesame oil is the key I think.  The sesame seeds don't do anything but that is a personal preference.

WOW!  This is delicious!  I had never thought of sesame oil and green beans but now it is an every day occurrence! I used EVOO instead of canola, just added some sesame oil at the end after steaming the green beans and added garlic (our preference).  The sesame seeds and peanuts at the end make this out of this world!!

This really adds flavour to your green beans!  Easy to make and it gets you out of the boring beans syndrome.

So easy to make and absolutely delicious!

I used to make this dish 40 years ago as an easy dish to bring to a group pot luck. I would add a little ricewine vinegar to the dressing, Since I cook by taste, not sure how much of any ingredient I used, but be sure you taste--and maybe add more roasted sesame oil and/or soy sauce. Always popular!
