This was an awesome dish. I used the same spice mixture (1/2 tsp Korean red pepper powder) as my homemade kimchi spice mixture and it was great!

It didn't say to rinse the salt off the cucumbers. I didn't and I think it turned out very salty. I followed the directions to a tee except for that step.

Yum, this recipe is a winner! I sliced one english cucumber as thing as I could by hand and then adjusted the ingredient amounts for the amount of cucumber I had. Like other reviewers I rinsed off the salt before wringing out the excess water for a less salty final dish. This is a cool and refreshing side dish I'm excited to make again!

I made this almost exactly as written, only cut in half because I didn't have 3 lbs of cucumbers. The only deviation from the recipe was that I followed other reviewers' suggestion to rinse the salt off the cucumbers before drying. It's perfect!  Exactly what I've been looking for.

Family favorite.  Never lasts more than an hour in the fridge.

Simple, refreshing, a little spicy. Very nice.

Used red pepper and 1/4 tsp of ground cayenne pepper as we didn't have any Korean peppers.  It tasted great. Thought that I was back in Seoul.

I love this recipe but like the tartness n more than the sweet so I add 1/4 c water and sugar and 1/2 c vinegar which makes it perfect for me!
