This recipe is super easy to follow and the cutlet came out perfect! fully cooked and super tasty. I have never battered anything before so I think I had too much bread crumb on my cutlet, I'm excited to make this again. Kontatsu is a comfort food but deep fried tonkatsu cutlet is too heavy. This is a great alternative.

I used A1 streak sauce instead of washer shire sauce and dry white wine instead of sherry sauce. I had to cook the pieces for 20 minutes instead of 10. Took a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes for everything to be done. Tasted  good, I give it a 5/10 without the sauce and a 7/10 with the tonkatsu sauce.

I didn't add the garlic to the sauce but still was good. Served with a bed of rice and a scrambled egg on top.

Was great, especially the sauce!
