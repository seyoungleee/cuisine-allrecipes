This was really good! My local Meijer did not have pork belly so I used a pork loin, but I followed the recipe and cooking directions exactly. Also could not find the Bonito flakes, so I used Oyster Sauce that I found in the asain section. (I read online that was a good substitute) The sauce was delicious!! Make sure to cut the meat into small pcs so that it can soak up as much sauce as possible. Served w/white rice and steamed broccoli, sugar snaps and baby carrots. MMMMmmmmm!

I have a hatred for meat that is sweet tasting. I took one bite and gave it to my husband. He liked liked it, but didn't think it was anything special.

Enjoyed the flavor. I used boneless pork ribs over jasmine rice with a side of carrots and poured the remaining sauce over the rice. I would love to try this with other cuts of pork.

Cooked Okinawa soyu pork and it was delicious, easy cook. Added kimchi and radish

Love!!!   Frequently requested.

Have lived in Okinawa 28 years.  But only recently started making my own soba and other delicious local food.  Added just a touch of awamori and is delicious!

Yummy!

This was very good. Easy and did not take half the day. I added some garlic chili paste, a spicy pepper whole and some spices. When it was done I threw the pork belly only,  on a flat top and caramelized it then added the sauce back to it. It was over the top and crispy by doing that. I doubled the recipe. Used it as an appetizer and it disappeared so fast I had to grab a bite before it was gone. Everyone loved it.

I didnâ€™t make any changes and we are most definitely having again.

My family LOVED this one, I will definitely be making this in the future, but I will be making more sauce to go with it!

made this to add to some Ramon and it was on point!
