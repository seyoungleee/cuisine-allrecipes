This was excellent and super simple to boot. Made as written and I do not feel any changes are necessary. I did grill the thighs whole but next time I might cut the chicken up prior to putting it in the marinade and then pan fry it. That way it would be already cut up and easier to incorporate into a stir-fry. Then again, I might grill them whole again. Why try to fix what is not broken?

Not bad, quick and easy. I used a no-name soy sauce and I would make sure to use a quality soy sauce next time. I think that would make a big difference in taste. Overall nice simple dinner.

Was very good. I made it exactly as written....but wasn't spicy.  Needs more spice.

I had 4+ lbs of thighs and so I 4x this and I probably could have gotten by with 3x.  I added a little sugar element to the recipe since most Korean BBQ recipes I've seen include one.

Went with less spice ( used some sweet chili sauce  instead of all hot chili paste), just to be careful, but it was delicious, with slight heat.  Next time I'll go with full heat, still add sweet chili sauce but go with more chili paste.

We loved this recipe.  Easy and full of spicy Asian flavor.  I can't wait to make it again!

used spicy honey instead of sesame oil...

I have made this dish twice. I used boneless chicken breasts instead of drumettes since I did not want to deal with bones. Came out great twice.  The second time I used sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes. Also excellent. I also added more spice to give it an extra kick.

It was moist and delicious.  It might be a little spicy...so go easy the first time (that's the only reason I didn't give it 5).  I would also suggest..baking it as suggested...and then broiling it for like 3 minutes or so to make it crispy on the outside (turn over on both sides)

Easy and tasty! Baked it this time - will try grilling next time (if the weather cooperates!)
