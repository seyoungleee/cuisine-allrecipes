This was really good. I did add crispy crumbled bacon and used dried dill.  I think next time I will add 1 teaspoon of caraway seed.

I made this in a pie plate, and only added to the ingredients black pepper and a few extra herbs into the cabbage mixture. I also added a couple decorative flairs on top of the pie using the extra puff pastry. The pie came out with a crispy bottom and beautiful top. This is delicious vegetarian comfort food!

Very simple to make and very tasty. I used Pepperidge Farm puff pastry sheets and with my over at 400, the baking time was 20min rather then 45

Delicious! Made 4 serving size since itâ€™s just the two of us. Perfect for dinner and lunch the next day.  Hubs surprised me with how much he liked the flavor and has agreed it can stay in rotation.  I did add some mushrooms since I already had them in the fridge.
