I was looking for an authentic recipe like my abuela used to make me and this was it! I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful! Making it today for a second time because my family devoured it the first time. Thank you for sharing:)

I'm not very familiar with what this should taste like but I really liked it. I left out the orange blossom water only because I don't have any. I replaced the sugr with Swerve and it worked wonderfully. I chose to make these in individual cups. Thanks for the recipe.
