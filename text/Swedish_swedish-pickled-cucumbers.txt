My grandmother and mother always made this recipe and taught me; however we add dill instead of parsley and sprinkled it with freshly ground black pepper.  Sometimes we added finely sliced onions too.    I often add alittle more sugar to suit my tastes.  It has been a favorite accompaniment of mine to all meat dishes or by itself as an appetizer.  I find it best after being refrigerated at least overnight.

My mum used to make this when I was a kid.I am defintely going to use your recipe!

They were fine but not as good as the IKEA ones or the ones my grandma used to make in Sweden when I was a kid.

Delicious!   Will definitely make again!

So delicious! I substituted dill for parsley and peeled the cucumbers and everyone loved them at Christmas dinner tonight.

Adding more sugar and chill overnight worked for us.

Made it as written, very good - I could [and do] eat them right out of the jar!   Just a note to the reviewer who said she could never get hers sliced as thin as her grandmother, I suggest you get a mandolin - they slice quickly, evenly and [if you want] anywhere from very thin to thick - check it to see the variances before you buy it if you want really, really thick or thin ones.  I'm going to try this w/ some of the other spices/herbs suggested - should be good w/ any and/or all of them!

Very good

I followed recipe to a T. First time I've even had pickled cucumbers so I don't know what I'd compare them to. However I thought they could use a bit more sugar, like review had mentioned. I did use fresh dill instead. Also sprinkled paprika, also reviewer suggestion. I'd make it again.

Good side dish, wakes up the taste buds for sure.

Excellent.
