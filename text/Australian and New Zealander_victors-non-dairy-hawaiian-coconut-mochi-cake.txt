Wow!

5 stars for taste, 3 stars for recipe clarity. I needed a GF/Dairy-Free dessert for my family gathering, since this dessert is naturally gluten-free it's perfect! The recipe writing is a little confusing with the Smart Balance amount, but after reading the standard Mochi recipe on this site (which calls for 1/2 c butter) I decided to go with 1 cup of butter substitute as I believe this recipe intended.  The batter is REALLY wet, I thought I had screwed it up, but I followed the recipe exactly and it came out really good. Mine only took 50 minutes to cook to completion. The texture is really nice, like a dense pudding cake. Sweet but not overwhelming. Will definitely try this again! Thank you for adapting it to dairy-free!
