My mother watches the latest Allrecipes and FoodWishes videos on Youtube every week. She sent me this one and said, "I want you to make it!" Chef John's Ba'corn didn't disappoint. So yummy. We ate it as a side dish with grilled burgers and a summer salad.

Delicious!

This recipe was a hit in my home. I did add a few ingredients, but I know it would have been delicious without the changes. I added diced jalapeño peppers and 1/4 cream cheese. I used mozzarella and sharp cheddar cheese. The next time I make it, I will add a touch of liquid smoke to give it a smoky flavor. Yummy! Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic dish, served it was ribs, marinated shrimp, roasted new potatoes, herb biscuits and tomato salad.  I used fresh corn because it’s what I had on hand.  Chef John knocked this one out of the park.

Found this recipe 3 months ago and I have made it 6 times since then. Family loves it and it was a hit with large gatherings too (isn't it great to have large gatherings again?). It is best broiled but if a broiler/oven is otherwise being used or not handy you can still take it hot to a party and no one will miss the beautiful browning.

Seriously this is incredible, that is all that needs to be said.

Wonderful flavors, easy to make. I might add, be cautious when adding salt to this recipe. Depending on the saltiness of your bacon and how much bacon fat you keep when cooking, it may lead to a very salty dish.

Big hit this Christmas! Did not change a thing!

This recipe is awesome. Made it 2x now. 1st time followed exactly and it was fabulous!

Excellent! I added a little more bacon, which I liked.  I probably sautéed 1/2 the corn a little too long - which made it a little chewy, but that was my fault.  Next time I will add 1/2 the corn with the onions, garlic and jalapeños and sautée 3-5 minutes. Makes creamy, cheesy, corn goodness!  Will definitely make again.
