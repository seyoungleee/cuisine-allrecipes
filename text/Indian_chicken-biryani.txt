this recipe is absolute rubbish , excuse me but it is not biryani its more like a mixture of tahiri and pullao

This really isn't the best biryani recipe I've made, but it's fast for biryani so I thought I'd give it a shot.

I had to double all the curry spices and added a good helping of garam marsala.  I never even tasted a hint of mint so I'm thinking that doubling the mint might help as well.

When you're cooking your rice, I would eliminate the onions and let the spices sit in the oil until it's nice and fragrant.  Then add the rice and cook for five minutes to let the rice absorb some of the flavors.  Once you've added it to the rest of the recipe don't cook on the lowest temp or it will get soggy.  You need to cook basmati rice on a med-low heat and much faster to avoid soggy rice.

This recipe is HUGE.  I cut it down to four servings and still had too much food.

I've made this recipe many times and I love it its so flavorful!

This is the second time I’ve made this recipe and I love it!!! It’s one of my go tos!!!

wow

Not a traditional biryani but it taste nice

It was well written very easy to follow and it was delicious 
I had to make a few changes since I used a premixed biryani spice but all and all it was great will definitely be making it again soon

I did mine in the Instant Pot

The flavour in this was pretty good.  Only changes I would make would be to cut the rice in half....there is way to much.  I'd also probably add a tad more chili powder (not what we Canadians call chili powder but "red chili" powder) and when prepping for the rice I cooked the seasoning in the oil before adding the rice to the mixture.  Overall a pretty good dish.

Good

i cannot believe someone would think this is not the best Biryani ever been made.  Truly delicious.  I make this dish at family gatherings.. a sheer crowd pleaser.  Thanks from the bottom of my heart
