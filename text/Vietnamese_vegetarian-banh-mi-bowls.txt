I really liked this.  The only thing I did differently was to add some asian chili garlic sauce to my mayo instead of sriracha.  I also added a little sesame oil to that instead of putting it in with the vegetables.  Oh, and I didn't have boil-in-the-bag stuff, but I used 1/2 cup of quinoa and 1 cup of brown rice (before cooking.)  Will definitely make again!

Its Looking Yummy

It was okay. I would not eat it again if I had the option, but if I was starving, I would eat it. I couldn't get over the mayo dressing. I felt like I was eating a spoonful of straight mayo - it was a mental thing though. The pickled veggies were pretty good and I might like it with another dressing.

I used almonds instead of peanuts, and cooked my brown rice instead of boil in a bag. I used "no chicken base " flavored  Better than Boullion instead of the  chicken , and used vegan mayo with asian hot chilli oil. It was pretty good.
