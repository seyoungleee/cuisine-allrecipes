Other than changing the ratio of meat to sauerkraut, we followed this recipe fairly closely. Used fresh onion instead of dried and celery seed instead of the flakes. Turned out great! Even I liked it and I don't like sauerkraut very much.

It didn't have much flavor.

I added an apple, used celery seed (what I had on hand) and kielbasa. It was quick and easy and quite tasty. I also used only 24 oz of sauerkraut and it made plenty!!

Tangy, little sweet,  and really good.
