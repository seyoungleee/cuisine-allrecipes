Absolutely Perfect !

These were ok, but not worth repeating.  They did get taller than the pancakes I normally make, but they were also a bit more dense than I like.

I was very disappointed……there must be something missing in this recipe. I am an avid cook and quite a good one at that. I just wanted to try something different. Much to my dismay these  pancakes are everything but fluffy with a blah taste. Sorry but this doesn’t cut it.

put the temp lower and flipped it as soon as bubbles formed

i love it a lots

A big part of Japanese souffle pancakes is their fluffy-ness. Instead of just well mixing the eggs, beat them until they form stiff peaks. After that you fold the batter into it bits at a time. This is what your recipe is missing. I really hope it helps you make the perfect fluffy pancakes.

Great recipe! Kids turned down their moms homemade pancakes for these!

Absolutely Perfect !

I thought they turned out great.  I only had almond milk instead of regular milk and used a little more till the consistency looked right.  I also added chocolate chips since I had some leftover.  I would make these again!

This recipe was quite the treat! Everything went smoothly due to the well-explained instructions :) It is my family tradition to add chocolate chips to pancakes to make them sweeter... but this time I didn't need any! It  is great the way it is! The flavor was fantastic! Thanks Rich B :)
