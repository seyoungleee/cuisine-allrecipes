This was a fairly easy recipe to make. It is an authentic Chinese cupcake, not an  American style cupcake. The sweet rice flour makes the inner part of the cupcake nice and chewy. It is very similar to the Chinese new year cakes that are very popular. The edges will lose their crispness if covered overnight so don’t cover them tightly.  Note: be sure to use the sweet rice flour not regular rice flour. They are not the same.

I made it.   I changed the flavor to Maple and they were delicious. My family wanted more. Will making again soon.
