these really were delicious. i served them with a side of spanish rice, although they were so filling i couldn't even finish my plate.

The recipe and technique were awesome. But I tried three different major grocery stores to find all necessary ingredients and couldn't find most of them. I found what they consisted of on the internet and was able to reconstruct enough that it made a dinner my family is already wanting me to make again. excellent flavor!

Really good.  I recommend this recipe.

This recipe is delicious!! I was able to find all of the ingredients and didnâ€™t change the ingredients for the steak, but I did use fresh avocado and chose not to use pico de gallo. I served this with my own spicy black bean recipe and limes, cilantro, sour cream, and mexican blend cheese.

Delicious. Used sirloin meat... will make again!

Oh it was a big hit with the group! Flavor and texture and presentation was outstanding!! Will enjoy this again.

The meat definitely needs to be tenderized first. And where's the cheese??

Reminded me of the Fajitas at our local Mexican restaurant.  I had cut off steaks from a rump roast I had.  Also didn't have Goya Sazonador Total but the ingredients in that spice include garlic powder, onion powder, salt, parsley, oregano and cumin. I had on hand garlic powder, garlic salt, parsley and oregano and added a combination of those instead.  If you "google" the ingredients you'll find some of the local food stores have the spices.

It was excellent!

I marinated the skirt steak in pesto overnight, it gave it a very tasty flavor, a dollop of sour cream is a must when making fajitas.

Excellent
