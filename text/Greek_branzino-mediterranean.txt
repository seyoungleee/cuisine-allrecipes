Thank you for the recipe! 
Made it just like you describe... well almost. 
I 'zested' up some of the lemon and mixed it with the onion that I put into the cavity. Other than that... 
Bottom line is the fish was a BIG hit! 
Gonna have to buy more bronzino (bronzini?) soon. 
Thanks!

The temperature was way too low as others have commented on. After 25 min at 325 degrees the fish was still raw. Turned the fish over and increased temp to 400 degrees and put on bottom rack for another 25 min and was just about done. Will try at 400 degrees on the bottom rack next time. Very clean tasting fish.

Absolutely amazing! Found the fish at Costco and never made it. It’s very light and flaky, wonderful flavor. I added minced garlic and herbs also a little fish sauce and it was delicious!

Amazing!  Brought back memories of dining in an Italian restaurant in Sardinia & Bella Napoli.  Easy to make also

I made everything in advance then let it marinate in the refrigerator for about an hour in all of it’s ingredients. It’s so much better this way and you can taste the difference!

Za'atar & oregano & thyme. Excellent fish for any occasion.

This is absolutely DELICIOUS!!! I make it exactly as the recipe calls out and every time we fight for the last bite.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Delicious, my husband even like it . Nice flavor will be making again .

It was delicious and fairly easy to make. I added tomatoes and red pepper flakes like it said on notes. I also added additional lemon juice and baked at 350 for an additional 15 min then broiled it for another 5 mins to get the top a little coloring.

Easy and delicious! This has become a standard Item on dinner menu now. My picky daughters love it too!

Loved recipe but had to cook longer on 400.
