I made this for dinner tonight and it was so delicious. My only change was a slight decrease in the salt, to 1 1/2 tsp.  Loved the flavors especially the carroway seeds. Made 8 rolls. Had a little mixture left so I added some bread crumbs and rolled into 6 meatballs. Will cook them tomorrow. I am not really big on the traditional tomato based cabbage rolls but these were awesome. Served with mashed potatoes and buttered carrots. Topped the rolls with a yummy beef and mushroom gravy
