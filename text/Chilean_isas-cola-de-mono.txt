I made this beverage one year ago for the first time and I make this very often. It is so amazing. I fell in love with it. Use rum (pisco or cognac), this is a key ingredient.

my husband is from Santiago. and we have this drink all the time is really Delicious...:)

This is the  Chilean version of Eggnog! I gave it a 4 stars, only because I think it is a little too sweet. Next time I will reduce the sugar a bit. Also, I made it alcohol free by omitting the  pisco and adding about a teaspoon of rum flavoring. YUM!

This is a good guide as to how to make Cola de Mono, but it needs more pisco, more coffee and less milk. I have found this recipe very useful all the same. Its so yummy, I want to drink it all year round not just at Christmas!

I am from Chile and this recipe was very good, but I had to give it a 4 star because it needed more white rum than the recipe asked for.

Thanks for this recipe, very easy to make and it tastes better after a few days.....is a keeper.

I gave this to my fiance and he renamed it "Cola de Bueno". This is awesome.

I liked it just didn't loooove it. Nothing constructive add as to why....just have other rum based drinks I like even better.

I love the spicy coffee flavored milk!  I used soy milk.  With or with out liquor this is a great drink!
