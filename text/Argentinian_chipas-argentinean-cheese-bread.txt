This chipas are excellent! yum yum yum... I mixed two types of cheeses: shredded parmesan and cubed fontina. Tip: at the last 5 minutes of the baking, sprkinkle parmesan cheese on top for extra... yumminess. good luck!

these were pretty good, i didn't have any tapioca starch so used plain old corn starch instead.  kids loved them warm with garlic butter at dinner.  thanks!

Excellent, followed recipe, easy, kids made. Everyone enjoyed. We will make again.

Great!! Even better with some white wine vinegar and vegetable oil to dip in... Yum

It was easy to make but a little bland for my taste.

I love these. Perfect. Thank you for this great recipe. They remind me of a Brazil style cheese bread. Super easy to make. Well, your fingers get a little sticky but that is worth it.

Not as chewy as I expected,

I hadn't eaten this bread since I was in the Peace Corps. The bread was wonderful--chewy and tasty and I didn't need a brick oven to bake it!
