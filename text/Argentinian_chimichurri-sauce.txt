Being latin I have tried many different Chimichurri recipes, I added lots more garlic, lots more Parsley and half the salt.

This recipe needs a lot of work. Use 1 bunch of fresh Parsley, minus stems. Use 1 bunch cilantro with the stems. Use 1/2 red onion, and 2 cloves fresh garlic. Nix the cumin, dried oregano and add some lemon juice and the recipe is golden.

Authentic Chimichurri sauce WITHOUT cilantro! My husband and two of my children think that cilantro tastes like soap. This is a very good Chimichurri recipe.

Very good but less salt would have made it better

This is absolutely first rate.  Uncomplicated when compared to other chimichurri recipes, but just as flavorful.  this is an excellent addition to the table for a summer BBQ.  My suggestion is to make it, just as written.  No need to gild the lily.

It was ok but I prefer the chimichurri sauces with lime juice and onion

Next time I will put more hot sauce in it and an onion

I almost made it as written, but I added fresh basil. It was great. next time I'll try cilantro.

So delicious!  Super fast and easy to make.  I used cilantro instead of Italian parsley.  I also used my Nutra bullet, it worked perfect! And I didn’t have frank’s red hot sauce so I use Tapatio.

Perfection! I made the recipe exactly as written. I noticed other recipes and comments had cilantro, but I did not have any, so I used parsley and oregano from our herb garden. We put it on rib-eye steaks and it was the best steak I have ever had! I think it would be equally delicious on chicken. You have to make this recipe. You will not be disappointed. (Fresh oregano is 1 tablespoon to 1 teaspoon of dried. It seemed like a lot but so glad I did not skimp.)

A little tangy but nice sauce.
