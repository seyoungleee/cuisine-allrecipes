My mother and grandmother always added whole allspice to the broth instead of cracked pepper.  Also you can add carrots and/or rutabaga.  It is the essence of comfort food on a cold winter day!

Needs all spice for sure! Plus rutabaga!!

I added a bay leaf ,more water and more veggies .yummy

My mom use to make this and added peppercorns, no bay leaves.

Favorite of my family.  Taught to make  by my Finnish Aunt. You must use 3 Bay Leaves to this recipe and only use butter NO MARGARINE.

I make this boiled dinner (Mojakka) with a ham base.  I boil down a smoked hammock for stock, add all the vegies: onion, carrots, rutabaga,  potatoes, and for the last 10 mins cabbage.  Spices are pepper, allspice, garlic, accent, and bay leaves.  Then add about two cups of chopped ham.  Hmmmmm on a cold winter day...  Of course a good homemade bread makes it even better!

Instead of beef roast I used a meat alternative and added a pinch of turmeric delicious

I have made this soup/stew many times... I also add 3 whole allspice, 2 bay leafs, rutabaga , and parsnips, this is a root vegetable soup after all... This is a great recipe to build off, to suit your family needs/likes... Thanks for the share... :)

Unfortunately we didn't like this at all. It tasted very bland, had to finish it by adding A1 steak sauce.

Needs all spice for sure! Plus rutabaga!!

Loved it.  It was soooo good.  My husband even complimented and usually he picks things apart.  I did add about a tsp. of allspice to it per some of the other reviews.  I cooked mine longer too.  After the veggies went in I cooked it for about 2 more hours instead of 1 1/2 hrs.  The meat was so tinder. Can't wait for left overs at lunch today!
