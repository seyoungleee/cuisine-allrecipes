The fresh lemon juice really shines in this recipe.   Followed the instructions to the letter, and I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks, koko, for a new potato dish.

Made these two nights in a row, grilling them both times; the first with oregano and I overcooked and over browned them. Watch carefully, as the broth evaporates quickly. Also, I found  I wasn't particularly fond of either the lemon or the oregano. Tonight  I tried them again, this time with fresh dill and I kept a closer eye.   Much better, although I still found them too tangy from the lemon juice.  If I was to try them a third time I'd either cut way back on the lemon or eliminate it completely.

Absolutely delicious! Authentic Greek and so easy. Gobbled up so fast no photo remains.

This recipe is amazing!!! One VERY important tip: Make sure your broth is room temperature when added. If itâ€™s cold from the fridge it will not evaporate and will be much soupier.

I made these and it was an instant hit! I will be making them again, but with more lemon as everyone loved that aspect!!

I have made these potatoes many times and I get compliments every time I make them. Very easy to make.

Lemony and good.  Added a bit more oregano.

This is my go-to base recipe. I prefer less lemon, more oregano and I add .5 tbsp of paprika and a few minced cloves of garlic.

I loved them but I boiled them in chicken broth first for 15 min

These are incredible! I didn't change any ingredients, but I mixed the broth, oil and all spices together right in the casserole dish I mixed everything in (as opposed to first coating the potatoes and pouring the broth mixture on top afterward). I mixed it all again halfway through the hour of cooking.They were perfection!

Is the chicken broth supposed to evaporate?  I baked longer than the allotted time and still had a LOT of liquid.  Taste was good, but no browning.
