I made this with the ricotta since that is what I had at home.  They were a hit.  I had to make another batch since it went that fast.  The recipe is fast and easy.

ROLLED IN CONF SUGAR, CINN AND SUGAR AND CHOC CONF SUGAR.

Farmer's cheese = Tvorog

I don't know how they are with cheese, but with tvorog they are delicious! Thank you for the recipe!
