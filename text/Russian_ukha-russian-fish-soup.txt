This recipe is almost "the right one", with only one exeption - NO LEMONS at all are used in authentic russian ukha. And it will be defenetly  better if you will use two or three kind of fish, and simmer potato in a clear fish boulion. This way it will be great !

More fish, more salt and a little less onion might help.  Definitely has potential.

After reading other reviews, I omitted the lemon juice and added a bay leaf and some dill. For the fish, I used some leftover baked red snapper and added it at the very end, just to warm it. It was great! Husband and I both loved it.

I was pretty disappointed after all the great reviews, but it was just so plain. might be good after a lot of changes.

Two variations:
1) Alaskan Ukha,  black cod (aka Sablefish),  halibut,  salmon,  octopus and or squid  mix.
2)  Lake Superior/ Canadian Ukha,  whitefish, walleye, salmon, sturgeon, menominee  mix.
--- Total of 3 1/2  to 4 lbs of fish with skin and fins, cut into 2 inch pieces or so;
--- 2-3  large potatoes,  cut into 1/2 in cubes;
--- Parsley roots and fresh parsley, may use dried in off season; 
--- 1-2 carrots- optional;
--- 4-5  onions;
--- 4-5  cloves of garlic;
--- 1 bay leaf;
--- 2 Tbls paprika;
--- 1 Tbls color peppercorn;
--- salt to taste;
--- 1 Tbls  dried dill (or fresh in season);
--- 2-3  Tbls  tomato paste;
--- 5-8 Tbls mild or virgin olive oil, 
--- Green onions, finely cut.

1)  In a 5 quart pot  Saute 3-4 coarsely chopped onions with bay leaf, paprika, garlic and a bit of salt in olive oil  on very low heat for 1 hour plus;  saute the octopus with the onions in Alaskan variation.  Don't skimp on oil- it will add taste and richness to ukha.  
2)  In a separate pot boil potatoes, parsley root, parsley, carrots  on low to medium heat  for  10-15  min.
3)  Discard the bay leaf,  place fish, peppercorn, dill on top of sauteed onions; add the remaining fresh onion whole or cut in two. 
4)  Pour the pot with partially cooked potatoes, parsley, ect  over the fish,  use additional boiling water if necessary to fill the 5 quart pot almost to the top.  Stir in the tomato paste and salt to taste. More salt can always be added later.
5)  Simmer on low for about 30 min.

Tastes very healthy. Came out great. Saving this recipe to try other fish.

I think I am just not a fan of fish soup. It was good, my daughter and roommate hated it. I made it with the lemon juice and also had to add a lot of salt. It was kind of bland to me, but still good. I added a pat of butter at the last minute. Very simple to make, I will try again when we go camping because everything is better around the campfire

Really like I remember it.  Came out great.  Wasn't sure about lemon, but it balanced the soup.  Cooked it in covered dutch oven.

This was pretty good. I didn't have parsley so I used cilantro instead and also substituted new red potatoes and it still came out good. I cut down on the amount of lemon juice and added a dash of cayenne pepper for little kick. I will make this again.

What a great dish this was.  I made it tonight and will make it again soon.  I did not use the lemon, and I used Mullet that I caught with a net.  Use plenty of salt it brings out the flavor in this easy to make dish.

I made this for the first time. But I added Carrots, Celery and Green Onion as well as a teaspoon of curry for colour. Everyone here loved it and I plan on making it again. Very good soup :)
