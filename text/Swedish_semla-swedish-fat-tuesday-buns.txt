What a delicious Fat Tuesday treat! These turned out beautifully and were very tasty. The filling is a little sweet on its own but when paired with the bun and unsweetened whipped cream, there is a great balance of sweetness. Next time I would put the buns closer to the top of the oven to achieve better browning. The husband and the sister were very impressed and I will definitely be making these again. Thanks, Chef John!

My semla buns turned out great!  Followed Chef John's recipe and instructions step by step and had fantastic, tasty results.  This recipe is a keeper.

This is INSANELY good. The only thing I did differently was add a bit of sugar to the whipped cream. I can't believe how amazing these came out. Perfection.
