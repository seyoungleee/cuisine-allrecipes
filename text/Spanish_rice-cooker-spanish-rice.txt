The recipe is too much for my older rice cooker so I made it on the stove in a large sauce pan.  it was very difficult to keep the rice from sticking-- if I made it again, I would cut the chili powder and cumin in half.    Just OK.

Used brown rice, so added extra diced tomatoes and juice. Also used   veggie broth and used less chilli powder too. It was really good, will be making this again.

I had a chicken breast to use so I cooked the bacon in a large pan. I then sautéed the onions in the bacon fat, added the diced raw chicken to brown a little. Then I added all the other ingredients except the bell peppers and some extra chicken broth and red pepper flakes. I was surprised that it was a little bland till I realized it needed salt. It was a quick one pot meal that I would make again with a little more spice.

My picky 7 year old loved it- I used veggie broth, and let out bacon and red pepper. Saving this one!

Unfortunately, there wasn't enough liquid to cook the rice. I used my rice cooker and it ended up being too small and the rice was only half cooked and really packed in hard. Next time I cook this, I'll use my Instant Pot and put in  3 cups of chicken broth, or use the rice cooker and use just one cup of rice.

This was a great success. I tweaked it some by sautéing the pepper, onion, and corn. I used bouillon instead of broth and then added a little water.

I am cooking this  for 2 hours rice is still not cooked... i cooked it in the rice cooker for 90 min rice is hard as  uncooked... 
Transferred it into the stove... still  cooking it.

Followed exact ant rice was still raw!

I used brown rice instead of white, took forever to get soft. I used too much tomato sauce, could have used about 2 cups of plain water

This WILL NOT work in an 8 cup rice cooker. We transferred it to the stove, but it couldn't be salvaged. I give it 3 stars because it has potential. We are going to cut the recipe in half and try it again.
