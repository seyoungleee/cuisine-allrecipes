These truffles are heavenly!!! Preparing them is a little time-consuming but your efforts will be repaid. The recipe here is very detailed and easy to follow. Try to use fresh chestnuts if they are available. It gives the truffles a richer taste. For variety, add finely chopped toasted almonds or freshly grated nutmeg to the truffle mixture. Thank you, Ms. LaLeeRu!

Didn't like these.. :P

I've been making these for the past two Or three years now.  My husband and I love them.  I have done some tweaking of the recipe. Most notably is that I use bag chestnuts rather than canned. This tends to leave it slightly drier which I then tweak with the addition of a little brandy.  I must confess, I'm still struggling with the dipping.  I cannot tell you how many screeching sessions and marbled looking confections have come out of my efforts.  This year I Will get it right! I love the story behind these. I wanted them since I was little and saw them in "Amadeus" too. I did find out later that the ones in the movie were made out of marzipan which the actress playing Mozart's wife ate, take after take, not knowing that she could spit them out . I believe it must've been her first movie , she ended up getting sick ??

I just made this recipe for Valentine's Day tomorrow. I used 1 teaspoon of Brandy instead of 1/4 cup.  The filling was perfect, not thin at all, so was easy to roll.  I also used chopped hazelnuts instead of chestnuts. The taste was great!  The only thing I would do next time is pour the white chocolate over the truffles on a cooling rack to make the coating look cleaner.

I did not try this recipe but I wanted to thank you for the tip about the food coloring. I thought it was just that I had the stove set too high. Thanks!

TY for sharing this! I have been wanting to try this for more than 15 years, ever since I first saw them in the movie, Amadeus, haha! I appreciate the detailed directions. This is definitely a time-intensive recipe and not one for a beginner or those who are impatient. But I love it!

Rather time consuming, but delicious! Pretty too... I used fresh chestnuts and premium chocolate.
