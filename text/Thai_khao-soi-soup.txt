My wife tells me it was the best soup I ever made her, I concur with her!

Great flavor!  Easy to make.  This recipe will definitely be a something I make again and again!

By far the closest to replicating my favorite restaurant's Thai red curry. This was delicious. I made it vegetarian, so used pan-fried tofu and substituted liquid aminos for the fish sauce. I think next time I might try adding Thai basil.

Excellent! Easy and a ton of flavor! I used rice because mistakenly bought noodles that needed to soak for 4 hours. Hubby went back for seconds! I did use an entire bok choy, added mushrooms and used 1.5 jalapenos because its what I had on hand. Definitely a keeper for winter meals

Delicious, very creamy and great flavor. Right back to Chang Mal with this one.

Lovely! Great layering of flavours. My family loved it. I used only three Thai chilis and I washed the seeds out of them. Thanks for putting this together!

This was amazing. It does take some prep, but it was well worth it. Flavorful and very unique!
