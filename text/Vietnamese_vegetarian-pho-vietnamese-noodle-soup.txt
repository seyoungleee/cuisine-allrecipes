Vegans rejoice!   This is delicious, as good as the best pho restaurant!   I couldn't find enoki mushrooms, substituted  small brown mushrooms, still good,.  Don't substitute the star anise, an important seasoning.  This will be on my menu all winter.  Mmmmm.....

Recipe was amazing, I cooked this with my Aunt and it was just all around a beautiful experience and a beautiful meal.

I added different vegetables. It was good. I'll have to practice making it.

Easy to make and delicious!

I thought it was great!

SO GOOD. A bit of work, but worth it. Pho is one of the things I miss most from my pre vegetarian days. This recipe was just as good. Thank you for posting the recipe!

This was amazing!  Everyone liked it.
Changes I made:
Chopped up carrot in the broth.  3/4 teaspoon anise seeds. Used Shiitake mushrooms because I could find them at the store.  Added snow peas and hard boiled egg to the fixings.

I didn't want to dirty more than the one pot so I cooked the tofu and the peppers with the broth so the tofu was packed with flavor. Also I couldn't find star anise but Asian Five Spice is part star anise so I used that. It's AMAZING.

So very delicious, it is one of our favorite dishes. 
 My bf isn't felling well tonight (NYE), I asked him if he'd rather have PHO than the meal that I had intended, he felt better at the very mention of it.

Its was great! I just added lions mane mushrooms and vegan seitan
