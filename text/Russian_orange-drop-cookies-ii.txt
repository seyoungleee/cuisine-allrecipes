After reading other reviews about how the cookies spread out strangely, I made the dough into small balls and cooked them in batches of 6 as I tested sizes, I made the balls of dough slightly bigger until they were at a decent size and I could start with larger batches. My husband took them to work for his coworkers (along with Mrs. Siggs Snickerdoodles) and they were an absolute hit. They were thick and moist as some reviewers complained (personally I rather liked it, it was a nice change from the other Christmas cookies I made this year), but the frosting was a very nice touch (and very pretty as well!). I also followed another reviewer's advice and did not mix the zest in with the frosting but sprinkled it on after I had frosted the cookies: it made a very pretty and colorful presentation. I will definitely be making these again.

I didn't have any problems with spreading like some other reviewers.  They kept their shape and were pretty cookies.  I was just disappointed in the lack of orange flavor.  I used fresh oranges from my neighbor's tree, but the flavor just did not come through.  They were too sweet and not orangey enough for me.
