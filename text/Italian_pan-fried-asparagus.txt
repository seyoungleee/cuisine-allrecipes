Making this recipe was the first time ever tried asparagus.  Now, I can't eat it any way but like this.  I serve this with dinner at least twice a week.  I don't use fresh garlic, I used jarred cushed or minced garlic (whatever is in the fridge).  I use two teaspons (hey - I like garlic).  If you do this, add the garlic in at the end of the cooking time as the garlic would burn if you added it in at the beginning as the recipe calls for you to do with fresh garlic cloves.

Way too much butter. They were like wet noodles. There's really nothing special about this recipe. I've had better tasting asparagus by just spraying the pan and sprinkling the spears with a little salt.

Great! I recommend adding parmesan to it right before serving, really gives it added dimension.

I found the cooking time too long. I had a mixed bunch of green asparagus which was too long for my pan so I halved it. I then fried the thickest end pieces first, slowly adding the smaller ones and then the heads. I only fried everything 7 minutes, and still some of the thin pieces had become too crispy and dry. Only a few of the thickest were really tender. Next time I'll try an even shorter frying time.

Very flavorful and delicious, if on the extremely unhealthy side!

Just as easy as described, though I was out of fresh garlic, so used garlic salt to season it.  I chopped up some of the semi-cooked asparagus and included it in a quiche I was making, but the rest went on the side. Truly a delightful side dish.

It was absolutely delicious.  My batty 50 year old brain needed a reminder how to cook one of my favourite veggies 🫣😋, finally cooking them for my kids, wanted to go all out yummm garlic, new stem asparagus... and you sorted me out.  It was delicious....At the last minute... I decided to add rosemary and it really did add something special 🌟🫶🏻💕Thank you... 🥰🪷⭐️🔥

I did so delicious dish , thanks 👍

Be careful not to overcook if you have thin spears.

Always happy with briefly pan-boiled asparagus before. This recipe builds on that idea of pan cooking, but now with the butter, oil and garlic it is really wonderful!

Very simple tasty recipe. One suggestion next time I will lightly sauté the garlic then  take it out. By the time the asparagus were sautéed tender the garlic was brown - not how I like it. So when asparagus is almost ready the garlic will go back in the pan for a minute or 2. But all in all a easy quick delicious vegetable dish.
