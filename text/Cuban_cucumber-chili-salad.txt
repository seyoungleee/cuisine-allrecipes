This was Delicious! ! So refreshing and cooling, can't wait to make this in the summer!! I only used a little bIt of chopped jalapeno and it was still Yummy!  Love this too much! Thanks delish dish.

This is an easy-to-follow recipe, and the results are interesting.  Frankly, though, the result didn't meet with our palate.  We were wondering what it would taste like without the mint, and then later, I thought maybe sweet basil might work better.  Still a bit sweet, but not minty.

Very tasty...crisp and refreshing. We may try adding some feta next time to kick it up a bit.

8.2.20 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/229645/cucumber-chili-salad/... While I liked this, I think I'd like it more IN a Mojito & have as a snack at the end of m'drink.

Added mango too - super yummy

Delightful! Went very well with a spicy meal. Even though this has hot chile (I used a jalapeno instead of serrano, it's what I had) it is still a cool and refreshing salad with the cucumber and mint. I think I'll use a bit less sugar next time, but still enjoyed this quite a bit.

The lime juice, fresh mint, and the serrano are the perfect partners for this crisp cucumber salad.  A real burst of freshness with just the right amount of "heat" for us.

yes and it was good,we like spicy foods
