My friend and I made this together for meal prep this week and WOW this curry is SO delicious!! I added quite a few ingredients to make it more full. I added chopped chicken, thinly cut bamboo shoots, potatoes and beans instead of lentils! What an easy recipe! Personally this was my first time making curry from scratch and I'm so glad it turned out so good! It tasted even better the next day! I hope to make the roti canai someday. Thank you for this recipe!!

Outrageously good. Not as coconutty as I thought it would be which is perfect for me. Will be making this plenty more times. I only made the curried lentil dip and for the flatbread I just bought some great store bought bengali porota which is an amazing substitute for making the canai.

I recently made Guyanese roti for first time & can't wait to try this out. This Malaysian version is similar but results in a crisper "crust" - looks really appealing.
