These are amazing!! I switched out the nutmeg for pumpkin spice and added two heaping spoonfuls of pumpkin. So delicious! Thank you for my new favorite pancake recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and the batter was way too thick. I tried making two pancakes with this thick batter, but they didn't spread out and the inside didn't cook without burning the outside. Those two were inedible. I added approximately another 1/2 cup of milk, until the batter was the consistency I was used too. It did spread much better and cooked much more evenly. The pancakes from the modified recipe tasted good, but the texture was still a bit chewy.

I loved this recipe. I used up some sour milk in this recipe as well as a 1/2 cup of sour cream. These pancakes were delicious! Nice and light. I was surprised not to use baking soda or baking powder, so they do not “rise.” The nutmeg was a nice touch. They are not as thin as crepes. This is an easy recipe to divide, and the half batch I made yielded 8 pancakes.  I will make these again.

Recipe was delicious, it actually taste just like the boxed mix. Few things to note: add a splash of vanilla, wayy less salt (i added a pinch and that was fine), pancakes were a little on the dense side so maybe a little more baking powder than recipe called for but it didn’t bother me too much. But overall recipe was great. Anything that went wrong was user error on my part (which was just having the heat too high so watch out for that)

Perfect Swedish pancakes!  My husband grew up on these in Germany and his name is Arvid so this recipe caught my eye.  I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting cardamom for nutmeg and they were delicious.  I need to work on presentation, but even though they weren't pretty, they were great!!  Thank you

These pancakes, or as my family assumed "crepes", were amazing, had a few technical issues with the batter but I just added some flour and we were good to go. I surprised my parents early in the morning and it made their day. The only changes I made were the toppings, replacing the suggested with some freshly cut strawberries, maple syrup, and confectioners sugar. I then asked my family what I should rate this recipe, and got 5's out of 5.

I followed the Cook's Notes and made three pancakes for one person with the exception of the cardamom.  This recipe is very similar to the ones I've made for my family for over 50 years.  These are a little bigger than the 6 inches called for, but that's just a small thing compared to the wonderful taste of these!  Thanks so much for posting your recipe!
