I've made this recipe many times and always get compliments on it.  I sometimes add a bit of vanilla too.

It didn't do anything for me. I was really grossed out by adding the egg once it was removed from the heat. It's just missing something. Some lemon peel maybe??

I have been trying to find a recipe that my mae use to make (I knew the recipe didn’t include water). This is the first one I’ve seen!  I did add lemon peel and cinnamon sticks during the cooking process. It came out delicious!  Thank you for sharing ??

It's awesome i added. Vanilla

I’ve been making this recipe for years. With a Portuguese background it’s the closest recipe I’ve found that reminds me of the amazing rice pudding I grew up!!

My family adds unsalted butter to the milk and lemon zest.  So delicious! I make this on special occasions.  I can see how some add vanilla.  That sounds good too.

I liked it but added lemon peel and made it thicker. Very nice thanks!

I hate eggs so I was scared to put 2 eggs and to taste like it so I only put one and it came out AMAZING!!! First time I've ever done and it came out delicious. Everyone loved it...

So easy and delicious!  
I doubled the recipe for a cultural event at my son's school and everyone loved it!  
I made it with whole milk.  
I followed the advice of others and added vanilla and topped with cinnamon.

The only sweet rice I will eat, just the way my Avo (grandmother) used to make it! Delicious, I finally have found her recipe, she passed before writing it down for me.

Excellent! This recipe is Absolutely Delish!! Loved it!! I did have to use light brown sugar and it worked out Wonderfully!!
