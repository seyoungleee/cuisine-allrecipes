Great recipe Nick!  This is as good as what I order in my favorite Persian restaurant. I made a couple of small tweaks 1) is used 4 cloves of minced garlic instead of green onion, 2) used baking soda instead of baking powder, 3) I added 1 tsp of Aleppo Pepper just for fun. My wife loved this!

Got my skewers on Amazon, and next I modified my bbq grill to hold the skewers above the grill top.
I got 12 skewers and they are pretty big, I was only able to fit 8 on my grill top at once 
Pay special attention to the way the ends of kabobs are formed to make sure the don't peal back during cooking.
This was delicious quick and cheap to make and my family loved it.
