I wish I had leftovers.  This was sooooo good!!  The sauce was incredible.  The chicken was melt in your mouth.  It was just a party going on in your mouth all the way around.  So easy but so fancy.  Chef John you are my hero, you make me look good!  I made EXACTLY as written.  I have wine left and I'd rather make this again than drink it...that says a lot.  You have to serve it with mashed potatoes.  I think it is against the law not to.

Edible...nothing special to write home about considering all the work you had to put into this dish with frying the chicken beforehand, etc.  Greasy & uninteresting flavor.

Prepared exactly as recipe. I expected more flavor. Enjoyed it, but slightly disappointed for all the prep and ingredients.

How can you go wrong with mushrooms and bacon with wine.>>Oh yah

One of our favorite recipes for special occasions or just because. I don't make any changes.

Delicious!!!  My husband raved over it all night long.  I followed the directions exactly and used a cast iron skillet.  The flavors were incredible.  Even my 2 young girls said that they LOVED it!   It was easy, but time consuming, so it'll go on our list as a special occasion type meal.  We paired with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Thanks for this delicious meal.

Any type of red wine can be used, do not be misled. It does, however, have to be one that you would enjoy drinking. Please do not use very cheap non robust wine, however as a qualified chef, do not use a heavily packed red wine.

It was heavenly!

We made this on a cold snowy night in SD and it hit the spot. I used a cast iron skillet  and it turned out great. Used a reasonably priced Malbec wine for the reduction. The sauce is to die for.

First time today after trying another 2 other recipes. Simply the best.I removed the skin from the thighs though.

My (grown) kids love this so much I have to double the recipe in order to have enough!
