Fresh. Delicious complex flavours that are healthy and easy.

This is a very good recipe and the dish was so good. I will make it again. I have recommended it to a few of my friends and they are going to make it . The seasoning and herbs pops.

Daughter, Alicia treated us with Mediterranean cuisine and we loved it!
