This was good. I like the eel sauce at my local sushi bar, it is thicker than this recipe, so I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. It was perfect.

A little too liquidy--didn't get a thick consistently like I wanted.

Great simple tasty sauce.Too thin: You didn't cook it long enough.  When it starts getting lots of bubbles, you are almost there.Too thick:  You cooked it too long.  It will thicken up more as it cools.

Cooked it wayyyyyy too long ðŸ¥² became a hard messy mess but it smelt amazing, canâ€™t wait to try it again!

I've just made this and it's really thick so I'm wondering if the people that said it was thin had the heat turned up enough?  Mine was really bubbly and went a light shade of brown, once it cooled it was so thick I've had to add more soy sauce.  Will try taste test tomorrow when I make sushi....

Um this sauce deserves more than 5. We have been making it for years. We make sushi bowls at least once a week. We couldn't have them without this recipe! Making it now!

Recipe worked great, if it's still watery you need to reduce it more. Carefully it'll tighten up more as it finishes setting though. I added a pinch of chili flakes and about .5 tsp ginger puree for some depth. Will make again soon.

The ingredients is OK 10 min is not long enough cook on hi until the sauce turns from black to a Carmel color then turn on low for 20 min stirring occasionally when sauce thickens up turn off let it cool and put into your container

Definitely thickened up just fine for me eventually and is really delicious. Also added a pinch of HonDashi powder to give it that good depth of flavor.

Please don't hate me, I had sushi and didn't have sauce so, it was an emergency: I used half balsamic vinegar and half apple vinegar as substitutes for the rice vinegar, it was awesome, easy, tasty and with the things that I had handy in my kitchen.

Came out really wellâ€¦I would make it again
