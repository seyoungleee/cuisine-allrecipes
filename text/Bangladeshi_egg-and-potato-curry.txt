Great. I've been looking for a recipe like this ever since a Bangladeshi classmate made it in college years ago. Served it on rice for a cheap, delicious meal.

Good recipe with lots of spice depth. Quick and easy, this vegetarian dish is very satisfying served with a hot toasted naan.

I didn't use the eggs or potatoes, but added chicken and broth.  I cut the Cayenne Pepper down by 1/2 and it was still plenty hot.  The flavor was very authentic.

Quite good and pretty easy.  I used about 2/3 milk and 1/3 water (to the same 2 cups), because I prefer a creamier curry.  I like the potatoes and eggs.  I used my steamer to cook both while I got everything together and prepped, so even starting without the pre-cooked eggs and potatoes, it was quick and easy.

Its a good recipe. Easy to follow and tasty. My family enjoyed it.
