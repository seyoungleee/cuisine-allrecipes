Made as written and this had great flavor.  My thyme and oregano are the only two that have survived in my herb garden through the winter and the freshness definitely came through. Again, great flavor and I liked the idea of not blending the sauce in a blender but I do think it would have been easier to eat with the steak if it were blended. This prep is a bit lengthy but worth it in the end.
