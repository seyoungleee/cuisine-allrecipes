This recipe seemed rather bland, so we spiced it up with lots of paprika,  fresh basil and a splash of red wine. We also used less chicken, more tomatoe paste, 3 carrots instead of 1 and chicken stock vs water.   Turned out to be a very quick, tasty and healthy meal which we would make again!  We only wished we had thought of some hearty rye bread ...

It's great! Use chicken broth or a bouillon cube instead of plain water.  I used chicken thighs (they don't dry out as easily as breast). I also added garlic and a little bit of celery. You can add red bell pepper (as my mom does) as well. I also like to precook the carrots/celery as I like them really soft. This is a classic dish.

The only change I made is that I used drumsticks instead of boneless chicken breasts. I thought the recipe was good but I feel it lacked a little bit of seasoning.

A very simple recipe made with readily-available ingredients, this hit the spot on a cold day in February.  I brined the chicken breast earlier in the day (so into this now!); substituted dried parsley; added some dried thyme; and used some turkey stock I had on hand for part of the liquid. It was delicious!
