This sandwich was strange in a very good way!

Delicious! Omitted the pate, added red cabbage and used radishes as they were readily available. My family loved it! Used buns from Sams Club. Just perfect! Thanks for the inspiration. Great flavors!

My family’s FAVORITE! I make a large pork loin roast and then cut it up into meal sized portions and freeze. When we are in the mood (about once a month) I just pull one out and slice while still half frozen and put the meat on the bread after toasting and pop it back in for a minute or two to warm up. Fast and easy and very delicious!

Very good. I  ended up adding a lot more hoisin and sriracha to the mayo than called for (it did say to taste I guess lol). Also omitted the paté

Our family of 4 all enjoyed these sandwiches.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Roasted the pork tenderloin in the crock pot with Banh Mi marinade ingredients from a sandwich website.  Easy and delicious -- we all agreed to make the recipe again.

One of my family's favorite meals.  We make at least once a month.  I use a quick pickle recipe for carrots and radishes.  It's spicy, cool, savory, crunchy, sour and sweet all in one.

Great recipe, the sauce is amazing. Goes great with Chef John's sandwich rolls.

These sandwiches are truly incredible. The texture, taste, everything about them is totally delicious. I made the recipe as written and included the pate.  Chef John knows his stuff!

Delicious, even my picky husband enjoyed.  I used a leftover pork tenderloin.

pretty good
