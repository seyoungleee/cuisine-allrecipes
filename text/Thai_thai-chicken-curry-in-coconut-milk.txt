This recipe was pretty easy to make, and the flavor was pretty good, but it tasted like it was missing something. Next time, I'm going to use more curry paste. Also, I'd recommend removing the chicken, and setting it aside, after adding it to the curry paste initially. (Adding it back a few minutes before the sauce was ready.) That way, the onion, coconut, etc mixture has time to cook a bit and simmer without overcooking the chicken.

Very disappointing. Followed modifications and added carrots, garlic, and tripled the curry paste. Flavor was very bland and only helped adding lots of sweet chile sauce. Won't be making this again.

It is a great basis for a start, it is far from the taste we would expect from a Thai dish, the basic is good but spices need to be added to make it real.It can be a great recipe when made with the right ingredients.

So disappointed. All the work and then it was very bland. No taste at all.

Loved this recipe. Next time I will add another red pepper and some snow peas. Otherwise, it was perfect. Love the lemony taste.

didn't feel like it was spicy enough for our taste and would have enjoyed a stronger coconut flavor

Such a good easy recipe! We add mushrooms as well. Sooo good!

I've made this a few times and enjoy with  the accompaniment of sriracha sauce.

Excellent! I served it with cauliflower rice. Soooo good!

The family loved it, made no changes to it, easy recipe to follow will definitely make it again.

This recipe is great! Only changes I made is; I added a whole bottle of red curry paste. I doubled the entire rest of the recipe & added 3 stalks of chopped bok choy (including the leaves), a can of bamboo shoots, & 2 tablespoons of honey. Tasted just like my favorite Thai restaurant made it. Tonight my family gave it 5 stars
