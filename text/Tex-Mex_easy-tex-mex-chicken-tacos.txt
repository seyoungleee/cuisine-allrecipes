TO  HOLD THESE TOGETHER HOLD WITH THONGS. WORKS FOR ME. LOVE THESE TACOS.

These were great! Getting them to stay folded over while frying was a bit tricky so I used a toothpick. For me, 1/2 cup of filling  was impossible for a corn tortilla. A couple of tablespoons max is all you could put in them to get them to fold over and stay folded over while frying. It is important to not skip step 3. The tortilla's need to get that flex in them or they will just crack and break when they hit the hot bacon grease. Great recipe!
