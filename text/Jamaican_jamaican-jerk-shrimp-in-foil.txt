This was great! I was afraid it was going to be too spicy but it was perfect. I did leave out the clove due to personal preference but that is the only change I made. I think you could the lose the sugar too for a more tart flavor.

Well; we learned something new tonight. We are not huge fans of nutmeg, cloves and allspice unless they are very subtle. The ONLY changes I made was jalapeño for habenaro and fresh thyme (my garden!) vs dried. The rest, followed strictly as is and? Not our favorite. Again, don’t think this is a recipe flaw but rather, just a personal taste preference.
