Absolutely fabulous, my family raved!  The only changes I made were marinating all day and adding lime zest and a little black pepper.  Served with beans, Spanish rice, and tortillas.

Very Bitter. Made a directed.

My family loved it!

This turned out awesome! Super tender and great flavor. I marinated it overnight instead of just a couple of hours but followed the recipe to the letter otherwise.

I made this as shown and it was great.  Will make again.

Made exactly as listed. It was excellent. I donâ€™t think my lime was large enough because it did end up being a little thick so I added more oil as directed. We grilled it and had it with rice and a salad. Plan to have the leftovers today as tacos. Will be putting this into our summer rotation for sure. Thanks for the th great recipe!

it was good because the chicken was the best part of all of it

We thought it was great. I made it pretty close to the recipe. I did chop up one serrano chili since I wasn't sure I could find the Ancho powder. Also, I used chicken tenderloins (2 1/2 lbs) 

My husband cooked it on the grill, was eating some on the way into the house. I can see using leftovers in tacos or spicy mac and cheese.

I made this, skeptical because I don't tend to like lime in well anything. I was absolutely blown away and am now addicted to this recipe. I made a few tweaks here and there including, substituting minced jalapeno and Serrano peppers for the ancho chili powder. (I was unable to find it at my local grocery store)  sauteing the chicken instead of baking it. ( just a personal preference) and I served it over Knorr Selects Rustic Mexican Rice and Beans. This dish all together. TO. DIE. FOR. 10/10 recommend you trying this at home.

Pretty good recipe. Followed exactly and was tasty. Now I can tweak it to my tastes to perfection.
