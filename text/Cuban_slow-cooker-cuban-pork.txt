4.17.20  I live in Florida with an abundance of Cuban restaurants.  My favorite dish to order always is Cuban Pork, so I’ve had a lot of it.  This may be a little more on the citrusy side than I’m used to and I'm not convinced you need the lemon as well as the lime (lime's traditional), but it is still very good.  I had a 2-1/2 lb pork loin, checked the internal temperature at 2 hours, and it already was up to 190ºF, so don’t expect “slightly pink in the center.”  It really needs the additional cooking time anyway to tenderize.  Typically made with a pork shoulder, this pork loin roast certainly was tender and flavorful (and less fat). Do plan on serving the broth in the cooker, it's delicious and necessary to keep0 the pork moist.  We’re having shredded pork tonight, and then I’ll slice the other two small pieces for the weekend.  I’d make this again.

It was good but the flavor was a bit sweet from the OJ.  Another reviewer said the same and that perhaps the lemon was not needed either.  I think just doing the lime would have come out too dry.  I think that next time, I will do the same amount of orange, lemon and lime juices.  It could also use some spice; I added cumin, a little chipotle pepper, black pepper and some pepper flakes after shredding.  Very moist, just wanted it a bit more spicy.
