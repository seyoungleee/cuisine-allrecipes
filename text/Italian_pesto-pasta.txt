I doubled the pesto and olive oil and added garlic (2 cloves). Also added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and some Mrs Dash tomato basil garlic to liven it up a bit. Served with chicken apple sausage. My hubby said this was a definate keeper.

I needed to use more pesto.

Tastes amazing! New favourite pasta recipe :)

Added rotisserie chicken, basil pesto, Italian peppers and onions and garlic. My favorite for now.

We started by heating oil and then cooking the onions until translucent. Then added the pesto sauce and threw in a little pasta water and salt and pepper as well as red pepper flakes with spinach stuffed tortellini . It was delicious and a big hit with hubby

Wish a recipe of pesto was included right here. Other than that looks great!

Cook chicken with onion and tsp garlic, then add rest.  Grate block of parm.  Great with rotini pasta.

Added 3 x the pesto and oil, added chili pepper flakes added garlic cloves. Added 3x the cheese as well.

I liked this recipe but I made my own version. I doubled on the olive oil and saut√©ed the onions. Once they became translucent, I added 1.5 tablespoons of minced garlic. After 2 mins of saut√©ing the gralic, I added tomatoes and spices (salt, fresh pepper, garlic powder, cumin powder, coriander powder and a bit of red chilli powder). I covered it to let the tomatoes soften a bit and once they were soft I turned off the stove and added my mixture with rotini pasta. I then added 4 big tablespoons full of basil pesto and parmesan and boy oh boy did this turn out to be the best pasta!! ü§§

This was delicious and my kiddos loved it!!
