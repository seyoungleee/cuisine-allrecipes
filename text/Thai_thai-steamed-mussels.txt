I halved this recipe, but otherwise followed it exactly. My only complaint is that there was not enough heat. I'll add dried thai chilis next time. The sauce is so incredibly delicious. Be sure you have some crusty Italian bread to sop it up with!!!

NOt a big fan of these, no heat..Thanks anyway

Very similar to our favorite New Years eve restaurant.  Very good and easy.

Delicious and very easy to make, given that I had most of the ingredients at hand. I substituted coconut cream for coconut milk and green curry for the red curry, because of availability. I used Picpoul de Pinet for the wine and some very fresh Swedish sourdough bread. I hope to make this for friends soon.

This is the fourth time I have made this recipe. This time I thickened the sauce with rice flour and it was even better. I also cooked the mussels in water removed them to the sink and removed half of the shell checked for crabs and missed beards then put them in the sauce for quick heat up. They were great. Cooking the mussels in the sauce made it to salty, this is why I cook them separately. The sauce is the best. Thank you

I absolutely loved this recipe.  Because the broth is so delicious I wanted to eat more of it. So what I did was to add Kettle brand Hot Jalapeño potato chips. They soaked up the broth perfectly and still had plenty of crunch. It was awesome!  I would definitely make this again & I recommend it.

All very much enjoyed, but think it needed to have more kick/heat, less sugar.

Great recipe! I added tiger shrimp and bay scallops to the broth and served over rice. Soooo good!!!

Just got rave reviews from my father who loved the sauce! Followed instructions and had fresh Italian bread as a side.

Wouldn’t change a thing!!! SOOO easy and absolutely delicious! (Actually, I can’t eat garlic, so I left that out).

Made this a few times . It’s a keeper!
