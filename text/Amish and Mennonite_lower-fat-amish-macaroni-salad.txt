We loved this macaroni salad, but I did use slightly less sugar (3 tbsp) than called for and added a bit of onion into the mix. I mistakenly boiled a full 16oz. box of macaroni but there was plenty of dressing for the full amount. It is very tasty Lorilynn, thanks for sharing!

Awesomely easy and yummy.

I made for the second time and my husband and I devoured it! I don’t change anything because it’s delicious as written! I cut the recipe in half because there’s only 2 of us. This is enough for the 2 of us for two meals. Thanks for such a delicious recipe!

very  tasty- I cut this recipe to half  for  only 2 of us- 
added colored peppers,  some chopped sweet onion,
and Tabsp of my  home made  zucchni  relish-- very good   summer salad -

Best macaroni salad I've had in a long time!

Very tasty!

3.15.18  I make macaroni salad often (quick, easy, fast).  The addition of the peas and the celery seed were new to me, and I liked both of them in this recipe.  I did add a little chopped onion and some red bell pepper for a pop of color.  This had just a touch of sweetness, but not too much.  We enjoyed this recipe with some sloppy joes and baked beans.

Love this & Have made it several times, just little less sugar , added red onion , used entire box pasta.  So Delish, will continue to make this

I used canned peas and no celery seed came out great. I will make it again.

Too sweet
