Very good flavor.  Just like you would have in Southwest Texas.  Very easy to make.  It's a winner!

Not bad. Personally, I would use half the amount of tomato sauce and sub fresh tomatoes instead. Same can be said about the garlic powder.I do think it’s a great foundation to begin with and then one can adjust ingredients to their own taste.

Everyone loved it and I only forgot to add salt. It is wonderful! Very much like my wife’s’ and mother-in-laws’ I’ve always called her Madre as she is so amazing and we miss her terribly.

I added enchilada sauce for a little kick!! Was really good!

My husband really loved it and I did as well I substituted the chicken broth for kids can you spread pepper soup after reading the first review. The squash does make a lot of liquid.

I thought it was great. My boyfriend said his mom used to make this growing up. So I found this recipe and he really liked it. The only minor issue was that it didn't take 2 hours, it was done in 1 hour. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is AWESOME!!! Just like my Grandma used to make. I just bought some boneless pork and chopped it up myself which was cheaper and saved time. Everyone loved it and it's a recipe I will definitely make again soon! ??

I make this often.  Love it!!

This is one meal that has been a favorite in my family for many generations with one difference. We use chicken instead of pork. Not as much liquid or maybe none needs to be added since the squash (Calabacita) releases a lot of juices. The dish is simmered on low heat with a tight lid as a last step.
