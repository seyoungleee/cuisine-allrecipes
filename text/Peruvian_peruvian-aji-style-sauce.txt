This tastes very similar to an aji sauce I find at a local Peruvian restaurant.  The first time I made this was about a month ago, and I've been hooked ever since!  It's great on chicken, rice, and can even be used as a salad dressing.  To achieve the preferred consistency, I like to use a mixture of two-thirds mayo and one-third olive oil instead of just mayo.  Thanks Dorothy!

So smooth, and with a little kick!
Grocery didn't have green onions, so I substituted chives, then same thing happened finding jalapeño so I used serrano.

This was yummy. I felt it needed a bit of brightness so I added 1 tsp white vinegar and doubled the mayo. I kept the seeds in one jalapeño for spice.  
Went well with Peruvian Style beer can chicken from AR.

OMG! I would put it in my cereal but I must have self control!!  I will just say I am a BIG FAN of this!!

Almost.  In my opinion, this recipe needs a bit of lime juice or white vinegar to get a bit of a bite. I also thought it was better with the addition of some ground coriander and cumin

Really good!

I want to replace the mayo in my next batch. Maybe avocado?

With my changes, I would give this recipe 5 stars.  The end product wasn't creamy enough for my liking, so I used 3/4 c of mayo (next time will use 1 cup) and I also used 3 cloves of garlic.  I didn't want it to be too hot, so I only used one jalapeno and I thought that was perfect.  I was trying to replicate a Peruvian chicken dish that came with this fantastic and addicting green sauce and with my changes, this comes very close to it.

This sauce was very good, I added a whole head of cilantro,the juice of one lime and a tablespoon more of vegan mayo and it was perfect!

Great
