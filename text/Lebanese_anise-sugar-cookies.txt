dough very soft and sticky and when baked it came out soft cookies instead of crispy.

My intention was to bake a batch of anise/springerly cookies when I found this recipe. It differed from the other Anise cookie recipes, especially having sorgham as an ingredient I did not have Anise Seed, so I used Anise extract. Other than that I followed the recipe accurately. Possibly this substitution was the cause of the cookie to have more of a molasses flavor than Anise. The cookies tended to harden on the bottom by the time the interior was done.The end result was a decent tasting cookie, but the flavor was definitely not Anise.
