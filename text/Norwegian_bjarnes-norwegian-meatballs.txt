I too grew up in a Norwegian-American home. Kjøttkaker’s are a favorite!  This recipe though after searching all over has everything!  I make these for anything and my boys always ask, “are they the Norwegian meatballs or no?”  Because they don’t want any other kind.  Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe! Bestemor er stolt!

Great vibrant recipe with the addition of ginger!  I made my gravy basewith mushrooms, fresh Italian parsley and of course, garlic.  If you have a shallot on hand use that as well.  I served my dish over butter noodles.

Just like grandma used to make!

Tremendous! Mange Takk for posting! Loved it. Try with garlic mashed potatoes or of course just regular ones.

Tusen takk! I'm Norwegian from both sides, plus Icelandic and Danish. These are spot -on and delicious - thank you for sharing your family's recipe.
