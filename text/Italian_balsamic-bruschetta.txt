Makes the perfect light appetizer/snack! I took the advice of others & threw in an extra handful of parm, just because i love cheese. I also toasted the bread w/ a drizzle of olive oil & a sprinkle of garlic powder, dried basil & parsley. Irresistable! Thank you!

The only real way to serve this without the bread getting moist at all is to deseed the tomatoes and dice up the tomato flesh only. This is the only way that real Italian restaurants would serve it. Rub the sliced bread with a slice of garlic. Lightly toast the bread under a grill. Retreave bread from grill and place toppings on except the olive oil. Lastly, drizzle lightly over all with a little, but good, olive oil. Serve immediately.

I’ve made this many times.  It’s amazing.  The only thing I add is basaltic glaze.  I let each person put it on to their taste.  It makes it from good to amazing.

Recipe was mint!!

Made exact. Just what I was hoping for. Simple and tasty

Was really great we’ll make it again

Yummy

I added some diced onion and put mozzarella on the bread woth the tomato

Great basic no fail recipe.If you are thinking ' wheres the onion' , well that is Pico de Gallo A different recipe.Add some diced Vidalia onion, diced peppers, chopped parsley and some hot sauce of your choice and you have a chunky salsa that is great.Another take on this is swap out balsamic for redwine vinegar.

Oh my goodness! this was terrific! super easy to make as well! I know I will  be doing this again soon!

So easy and delicious!  I used one roma and a few tomatoes my neighbor gave me.
