This made a lot of sauce. I used some of the sauce to do a 15 minute counter marinade for two pounds shrimp and still had enough to sauce a pound of pasta. Grilled the shrimp and served on top of the pasta. Next time I will probably add a little cayenne. Thanks Chef John for a new summer/early fall favorite.

It was very tasty and refreshing on this hot summer evening. Scaled it down for 2 servings and it worked very well.Next time I will blend it a little finer and let it set to have the favors meld better. The store bought pasta water did not contain enough starch to thicken it much, so next time may add a corn starch and water mix.

Food processor is better than the blender

Was very good and a great way to use up an abundance of tomatoes.

Delicious! Our garden is popping off with cherry tomatoes and basil right now so this was a perfect use of our fresh produce. I used this to sauce a homemade white pan pizza after it came out of the oven. Everyone loved it and we had enough leftover pesto to send home with our friends. I'd post a photo, but the food was gone after a few minutes.

I made this for my wife who is hugely picky. She said it was the best thing I’ve ever made for her. However, when I got home, the bag of almonds I had were gone. So I substituted the same amount of pumpkin seeds that I toasted just before grinding them in the pesto. Sprinkled a few toasted seeds on top. Sorry I didn’t take a picture. This was a quick, easy and delicious recipe that I will make for company and act like I know what I’m doing!
