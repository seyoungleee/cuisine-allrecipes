I am dairy free and gluten free ( food intolerances). So I used gluten free bread crumbs, gluten free light soy sauce, dairy free plain yogurt and used almond milk in place of milk. I Will cut back a little on bread crumbs next time but over all it had great flavor.

I made enough meatballs to serve 10 people.  I used bouillon for the broth.  Everyone enjoyed this recipe.

Great flavor and relatively easy to make.  So why do all the pictures show mushrooms in the gravy, but none are listed in the ingredients?  Just wondering. I added some  to mine and thought it was wonderful.

They were great! I served over egg noodles and yes we will have again!
No changes required
