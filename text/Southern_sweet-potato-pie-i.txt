I've made this a few times and the recipient always loves it.  One suggestion--don't store the boiled sweet potatoes in the fridge when you don't have time to make the pie right then...it separates a bit and makes the pie grainier than it needs to be.  It's much smoother when the directions are followed and it's mixed right after boiling and peeling.  :)

this is good as far as the ingrediants~~~ however, to make it awesome... need to separate the eggs, and beat the whites until they are stiff, then stir that into the rest. NOW that makes it perfect!

Added a pinch of ground cloves and ground gingerâ€¦. It was a HIT these past two years.. decided not to make any this yearâ€¦ received a late night call requesting it..

1st time using this recipe and I must say it turned out AWESOME!!!!!! IF I DO SAY SO MYSELFðŸ˜†THANK YOU! HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!

I added 1 tablespoons of cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract because I like a little more touch of flavor . I also used evaporated fat free milk, it came out perfect and tasted delicious

So simple! My husband really wanted sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving this year so I attempted it. We havenâ€™t eaten it yet but it looks and smells delicious!

Great Recipe my family loved it this is one  to pass on Thank you!

I made it with canned yams and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar . It was really enjoyable

I made as per the recipe but didn't have a fresh sweet potato, so I used one 40 oz can of cut sweet potatoes drained.  I also used mini pie crusts, so cooking time was reduced to 40 minutes.  Still turned out great! The filling made 20 mini pies.

I haven't tasted it yet, it's for tomorrow's meal! But it was EASY to make, smells good and I can't WAIT to dig into it!!!

I use this recipe all the time . I just made 10 pies for thanksgiving.
