This is the best fried cabbage recipe I've ever had!  The flavor is wonderful.  I've made it twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, but decided to make a few changes when I made it the second time.  I didn't use the oil for frying the bacon (you really don't need it) and I took the bacon out of the pan when it was done.  It gets a bit soggy after you add the cabbage because of all of the natural moisture coming out of the cabbage as it cooks.  I added it back in when the dish was almost done.  I also found that it needs more time to cook, but I guess that's a matter of personal choice as to how crisp you want the cabbage.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE!!!!!

Made this twice. The first time exactly as written, the second time, I omitted the oil and doubled the bacon, just using the bacon grease to cook the cabbage in. It's so much better this way. Oh, and a tablespoon of sugar instead of a pinch. So good...

Gor a beautiful  head of cabbage at the farmers market a few weeks back and I needed to cook it before it went bad! Looked up this recipe and it was yummy! Just like grandma and mom use to make! Excited to share with my Canadian fiance ;)

So good!!!!

Excellent recipe .I cook it often. Its even better with a little garlic added.♥️

I made this with no changes.  It was very good, though I think next time I will use less oil.  1/3 cup was not necessary in my opinion.  I'm from the north and the only way we've eaten cabbage was boiled with our corned beef.  Now that we live down south, I'm cooking more and more southern food.  On to the black eye peas that I always thought were peas....

I used much more bacon 🥓  It was delish!!

Didn't change a thing. Made it in my Air fryer. Delicious!

I omitted the oil for the bacon. I also didn't add sugar might try it another time when not cooking for my sisters (they're diabetics). As I prepared it it was delicious!

I love this recipe! My cabbage came out Amazing 👏🏾 💜💜💜

Excellent reminded me of my ten years living in South Carolina and the amazing food in that region
