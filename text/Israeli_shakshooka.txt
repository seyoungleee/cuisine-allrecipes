I didn't have saffron, but it was still really good

Might just be me, but I found the sauce extremely bland. I could see this being good though.

There are a few other versions of this recipe here on Allrecipes.  I've tried two others plus this one over the past month, this is my favorite!  I'm cooking for only one, so after making the base of this dish I divide it up to freeze. Then all I have to do is heat up one portion at a time, when it's hot I add a poached egg, doing it this way in no way alters the flavor.  This is a keeper.

This was great!  Made it with canned tomatoes.  I didnâ€™t have hot paprika so I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  Topped it off with a bit of feta cheese.  My husband, who is 1/2 Palestinian, loved it.  His dad used to make a dish quite similar to this.  It was a big hit!

I used Tumeric instead of Saffron. I  didn't use as much garlic. I used canned tomatoes with no salt instead of fresh tomatoes. I did use black pepper, onion and garlic powder. And seasoned it to my taste! Wonderful dish!

Found the sauce a little bitter for my American taste, so I added 1 TBS. sugar, with that this recipe turned out very good . I would make this again. Loved the saffron and paprika flavors.
