i used this recipe as a "base" and adjusted it to fit our taste.  i replaced the lemon-lime soda with pear juice (that was the only thing i had in the pantry..i imagine any mild-tasting juice would taste good too) and replaced the lemon juice with freshly-squeezed orange juice.  with extra ice, my family said it was the best virgin strawberry daiquiri ever!

This has an OK taste, but it is not really a daiquiri.  You should replace the lemon lime soda with strawberry daiquiri mix and I would definitely add more fresh strawberries in the recipe.  The sugar is not necessary for a daiquiri and should be left out completely and the lemon juice should be replaced with orange juice.  You may also want a few more ice cubes to get a daiquiri like consistency.  Also, this does not make a very large serving, so you may want to double all ingredients.

not lemony enough and the recipe suggests way to much sugar

Delicious recipe added more Strawberries ðŸ˜œðŸ˜‰ Nothing that I would change!

I used frozen strawberries, so added about half the ice.  Used about 3/4 cup frozen strawberries per serving. Cut the sugar in half.   Loved it.

The recipe was great! I substituted the  lemon lime soda for Hawaiian Punch this time and it was phenomenal

My daiquiri needed more ice because it was watery, but it tasted good

Very good

Delicious

I absolutely love this! I made it for "happy hour" with my daughter. The first batch I made as the recipe said except I used lime flavored carbonated water and it was a little too sweet for me. So when I made again I only used an 1/8 cup of sugar and that was perfect. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

i added a bit more sugar and ginger ale soda , i also used more strawberries that were frozen fresh. The flavor was pretty nice.
