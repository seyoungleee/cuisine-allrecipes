I loved it. of course it's similar to my grandmas old recipe and taste just as well. I added a tiny bit of nutmeg and cinnamon and bamm! totally recommend it.

My boyfriend is Puerto Rican, so I've had my fair share of tembleque! I always like trying new variations though. The ingredient amounts seem way off in this one - not sure if this was intentional or an error.  I realize the cook's notes say to use more or less sugar to taste, but I can't imagine how sweet it would be using the full amount. This recipes uses 2 to 3 times what most other tembleque recipes call for.  I only used 1.5 cups of sugar and even that was quite sweet. The major problem I had was the amount of cornstarch. This recipe uses double what most recipes use. It seized up and was so thick that you could no longer whisk it, and there was no way you could pour it through a strainer, or even into the molds. I understand what the other reviewer meant by it looked like 'dough'.  It set up fine, but the cornstarch flavor took away from the coconut. I would definitely make some adjustments if I were to make this again.

I tried this recipe followed it step by step and it did not turn out right it was all thick it looked like dough won't be trying this again
