I like Chimichurri recipes that don't have cilantro in them. My husband and two of my children say it tastes like soap. Apparently there is a percentage of the population that report the same. This is a very good take on Chimichurri. I think this is my new recipe.

Yummy!

So easy and tasty! Thanks for the recipe
