The smell of this baking is enough to drive you crazy.  So delicious.   I will say - be patient with the rising times - mine took much longer than stated - but that might have been that it was pretty chilly here.  I also used the zest of one fresh lemon - I had no dried.  I am not Polish and I had never made a Babka before - this will be the start of a whole new tradition.

I’ve made this 3 times. The dough is amazing.  The filling is a disaster.  It’s way too wet.  The twist makes it worse.  What’s the purpose of making it this way when 50% comes out the ends? I’ve seen other versions that use just the egg yolk and/or cream cheese mixed with the farmer cheese.  Will try that next time.

The cheese filling was to loose with ricotta.    Next time I’ll try to strain it.

The dough comes out beautiful 😍 A bit proud of my 1st ever babka, it's upside down 🙃 cause my wonderful other half suggested to add chocolate chips so I did and then realized 😳 you flip bundte cakes over 🤣😅😆🤣😅😆 nx time I'll know better.   Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  Since moving from Jersey to Florida, really missed having Babka for Easter.

My mother in law passed away early this year from COVID my husband devastated.  Every year she hosted Christmas breakfast and always had cheese babka.... my husbands favorite.  I went to 5 bakeries and the all none so I made this recipe....it was exactly like his moms it made his Christmas.  I myself never liked babka but ate some myself and this will now become a family tradition.  Thank you

Loved this!!! Smells divine while it’s baking!! There’s definitely a learning curve to twisting the dough and getting it in the pan and not losing filling but well worth it to keep trying baking new ones!
I added a crumb topping to mine because that’s how I know Babka to be!! This is really delicious, I will be making this a lot, especially for Easter!

Amazing recipe..  Quarantine from Corona virus keeping me from my favorite Polish Deli that sells this.  Part of our traditional Easter Breakfast.  Made it and it was a complete success.  My trial run is almost gone and now have to make 5 for Easter.

I apparently don't like Babka, but it did look nice and the texture and flavor was all there. Just not to my tastes.

I love love love this! it's PERFECT! I moved away from NYC 17 years ago and haven't had good cheese babka since... now I can make my own! Thank You!

This is a good bread.  Don't expect anything too sweet.  It is a rich white yeast bread with a sweetened cream cheese filling.
