I've heard about these cookie/waffles and have been long looking for it recipy. I love them with Strawberry jam filling.

I have a pizzelle iron and have made pizzelles and waffle cones using other recipes with no problem. When I used this recipe for the stroopwaffels, the batter spread too thinly and stuck to the pizzelle iron. I could not get a whole cookie out of the entire batch. They all came off in pieces so there was no way I could even sandwich any of them together. I would have liked to, because the pieces were really quite tasty and crispy. I'm not sure how to "fix" this recipe, other than to add maybe more butter to help with the sticking issue. I would like to know if others experienced this same problem??

Very easy to make....and a great lemon flavor.  Refreshing!
