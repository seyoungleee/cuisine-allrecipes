Very good.  We added about 1/4 c finely shredded hard cheese.  I would also suggest dusting your hands with flour to keep them from sticking to you.  The flavor was very nice, make sure to cook them slow but not too slow because they will burn.

lovely , moist, & flavorful meatballs but
where's the Allspice ? I always thought Allspice was the spice ingredient needed to make this authentically Swedish .

Easy and simple! Taste delicious.  My go to recipe from now on.

As a diabetic, I always get frustrated/irritated when I see sugar in a recipe. I simply omit sugar or substitute Splenda. I will be making these tonight and can't wait!

love it , i remember having in Norway all time and still have

Lacks:nutmeg, black pepper and soy sauceThis is a very simplified recipe and not authentic. Good if you don't have any spices or soy sauce at home

Great recipe and authentic to what mymother in law  made except she added All Spice which was a required spice for these in Sweden.

I stubstitued the hamburger with deer meat and would say donâ€™t use any water when using venison. Made with Alfredo.

will make again

These meatballs were delicious!! I found the step of mixing the breadcrumbs with the half and half to be a bit unnecessary. I mixed the breadcrumbs alone and the meatballs still came out good.

A simple easy recipe. Make extra and freeze.  Even found Lingonberry  jam and really like it paired with the meatballs.  Only change was I cut the salt in about half.  Easy to add extra if you wish.    Thanks for a great recipe!  Used this for samples at a farmers market event.
