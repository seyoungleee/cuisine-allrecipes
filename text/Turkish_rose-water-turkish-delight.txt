I followed the recipe to a tee...I made pink rubber.

We made this, during the last 5 mins the mix started to burn at the bottom of the pan and flake, the TD stuck to the foil and turned out like a very gross sightly gummy but mostly chewy mess, it also tasted like unflavored gelatin even though i added a lot of flavoring. it was very easy to make but it turned out really bad, we be searching for another recipe for Turkish Delight :)

This is so completely wrong not sure what this is but it isnâ€™t Turkish delight

I followed the recipe to a tee...I made pink rubber.

The flavor was very nice and it was easy to cook, but this stuck.. terribly. I sprayed with cooking spray as directed and used foil but this method was a failure.  It is possible I have defective cooking spray or defective foil..I couldn't get the foil peeled away with out it flaking off in teeny tiny pieces... if at all. The few bites I was able to salvage tasted very good though. If I ever try this again, I will use my Silpat mat to line the pan. Editing my review.. I left the candy out for a bit and once it warmed up I was able to peel the foil off better. It still wasn't easy but it did improve. Possibly need to use non stick foil as well...this might improve the recipe. It still tastes good, but beware of the sticking issues.
