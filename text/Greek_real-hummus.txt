RECIPE UPDATE

I'm the author of this recipe and I wanted to make a few updates.  I now use cumin instead of the black pepper.  You want 2 cloves of garlic overall.  To adjust the texture between creamy and more solid (which is very good also) vary the amount of liquid you drain from the can.  The more liquid the creamier, but lately I've been draining all of the can except for 1/2 cup.  I now use 3 large tablespoons of Tahini instead of 2.  I also take the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon and add it gradually as the blending occurs.  Peanut Butter is no substitute for Tahini!  If you're using peanut butter, you're not eating real hummus.  Find it at an international food store

I'm sorry but this was a disaster, the salt was so strong that we ended up trashing it

Easy and delicious

Super easy and delicious. I added extra roasted garlic to mine

I mix this in a food processor for a full 5 minutes. This gives a really smooth consistancy. This hummus gets high praise every time I serve it.

I realized half way through that I was out of lemon juice, so I subbed red wine vinegar. Got confused and added the half reserve of liquid, so mine turned out a little too runny, but the flavour is great!

Absolutely delicious. I made one mistake in adding the olive oil during  processing, but it didn't have an adverse effect on the end result, or the taste. I intend to make this again soon.

Revised recipe is outstanding!

Delicious ... but I added about 1/2 tsp cumin and a little more salt.

Substituted cumin for pepper

Easy and delicious!
