my go-to recipe for traditional Dutch apple pie :-) I usually add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, since 1 tablespoon can be a bit overpowering.

I followed the recipe as written.  I liked the contrast of the slightly sweet crust with the tart Granny Smith apples.  I used store brand raisins.This recipe turned out as good as the one we made with our Dutch exchange student.

My family loved this. I left out the sugar in the pie crust, just using some to sprinkle on top of the crust. I love how the apple filling has no butter nor too much sugar. The filling is sweet and thick because of the apples, naturally. So lovely!

Soggy base, too little browning and undercooked apples even at the far end of the timings, i'd try this again but knock the oven temp up a bit and toss a little polenta into the case to prevent some of that sogg

Will make it again....it was easy
