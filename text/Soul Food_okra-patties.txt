You must spice these up a lot! and then they are delicious. I substituted whole wheat flour instead of regular. I added salt free Tony Sacheres (sp?) and hot sauce. My family really enjoyed these. I also only used cooking spray instead of deep frying these and the cooking time went up to probably 4 minutes per side on pretty high heat. Thanks for this recipe. I will use it again when my okra produces in the garden!

OK, so I didn't mince the okra.  It was thin sliced.  Maybe that was the problem.  It was like okra hushpuppies.  Maybe I'll try again and put the okra in the food processor, but it would just be easier to bread and fry.

This was an excellent receipe. I will never just cut up okra, bread it and fry it again.  Putting it in patties with the onion and I added sweet peppers was amazing and so much better.

I was disappointed in the taste. I expected these to have a more noticeable okra flavor. I shall make again but will use less flour and adjust seasonings.

I made this just added 1 tsp of onion powder a dash of cayenne pepper. It was absolutely delicious.

I made it just like it's written, no changes. Delicious and quick!

I made these and added a few jalape√±os and reduced the amount of cooking oil. Much easier to fry than traditional fried okra. Will save the recipe

Make sure to add just a little garlic salt when ready to serve.

5 stars!

Enjoyed it very much.

Okra turned out great, even made them into little mini bite sandwiches
