A good versatile seasoning that can be adjusted to lower the sodium. You can put this on just about anything.

I cut the salt in half, and it worked well for a chicken recipe I made.

Wow! So much better than the store. Very easy to adjust. Minor changes to mine. 2 T Garlic powder, 1.5 T Onion Powder, 1 T Kosher salt, all else the same. Used coffee grinder to complete the mixture. Turned out awesome! FYI, the pepper adds a nice kick, so know that before you add 2tsp.

Absolutely great! Mucho mejor que Goya

I will be using this recipe, but I will have to be honest, I can't use Turmeric, I'm allergic to it, and I ran across a comment, that said she substituted the Turmeric with Cumin, and so when I make mine, I will be using cumin also.  Turmeric breaks me out in hives everywhere, starting with my hands, arms and then face.  THANK YOU,  to the person that used cumin and passed on that idea.

This is our first experience with turmeric in a spice blend and this is teaching us to love it!  I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon turmeric but I think it could go with even more!

I use a little different ratio; "double" each ingredient as you progress:  0.5 tsp turmeric, 1 tsp oregano, 2 tsp black pepper, (4 tsp salt), and 8 tsp (3 Tbsp) garlic. Recently I began to omit the salt for health reasons, as it can always be added at the table if needed.

I needed adobo seasoning and didn't have any. This worked out great. Thanks!

Loved it, used it recently with a batch of grilled chicken and Puerto Rican inspired beans and rice, arroz con habichuelas.

It becomes a staple in my pantry now. I used it when I made the Cuban Ropa Vieja dish!
