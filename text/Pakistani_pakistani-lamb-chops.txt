Another great lamb recipe! It’s different than any I’ve used and a nice variation. I couldn’t find any black cardamom so I used 4 green pods.  I wasn’t sure whether to add them whole and green or toast them and use just the seeds... since the recipe didn’t specify, I used them whole and did not toast them. I also omitted the cilantro because my husband hates it.  I expected this to be quite spicy, but it was only mildly spicy. Very tasty though, and everyone (4 adults and a toddler) liked it very much!
