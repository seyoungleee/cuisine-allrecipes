Made as written except that I used fresh oregano and chose to use only 1 bell pepper due to personal preference. Black beans always seem hard to flavor to me but this recipe seasoned them nicely. It never really thickened for me so next time I will eliminate the water that gets added in step 4. I'm also not a vegetarian so I'll use real bacon next time but this was a great alternative for people that don't eat pork. Thanks for sharing!

Good flavor but beans did not soften.

I have made this recipe so many times now and each time it comes out delicious!  The flavors of the cumin and smoked paprika are the stars to this dish.  My family loves draining the black beans from the leftovers and making wraps!

Delicious. Changes, HM chicken stock, fresh spices from Penzys,  can Rotel tomatoes mild w/green chili and a splash of balsamic. Thickened w Masa. Served w Tortilla chips... SO good!!!
