I scaled this down to 6 servings (1/3 of the recipe) and followed the recipe precisely. Note for others, the batter is very thick, not like a normal cake batter. The taste is alright, but this cake is VERY dry, and you definitely need to have a coffee or tea with it. We will eat it, but it's not something that I will make again.
