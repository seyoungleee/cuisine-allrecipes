While living in Germany I had opportunity to try many local dishes.  Aside from jagerschnitzel, this one one of my favorites.  This recipe tastes just like the one I had in country.

This was a good as I had in a German Restaurant in Washington DC on 4th Street. It was very easy and went well. I used less oil and vinegar. Plated this on a bed of mixed greens and served with sliced radishes. Was great.

Very different, but good. We didn't have time to chill it 2 hours, but I'm not sure it would make much difference.

This is a very delicious dish. I didn't change a thing the first few hundred times I made it, but am toying with adding roasted red peppers or jarred mushrooms. We'll see. It's hard to improve on perfection. I wish I'd found this recipe sooner!

Very good. I made this recipe after returning from a trip to Germany and it brought back wonderful memories of the beautiful Bavarian alps!

Very tasty!  So simple, but so rich in taste.  Good choice for something different.

Good Stuff. Would make a great salad with
penne or blended with  Mid-Summer Italian Bread Salad (which see on this site).

Thank you - my Oma and Opa used to make something very similar to this. Wonderful.
