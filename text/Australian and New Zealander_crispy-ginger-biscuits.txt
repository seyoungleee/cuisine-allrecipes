I made it. Crystallized ginger  was not readily available. Instead I used tender fresh ginger, chopped and soaked in honey. The biscuits turned out fine.

Very nice. I decided to double recipe. I rolled then flattened the circle, added a dob of strawberry jam. Then I rolled and flattened another and gently topped it. I did use sugar of course. Just spin them on the tray and seal the edges.
