This is a wonderful, The first time I made it for about 100 people, mostly teenagers for an International dinner. Many come and told me how wonderful it was. It can be a little scary as you put it together and the batter looks way to thin, but it will turn out great.

No changes.

Love it. Made custard with mine. Without sauce, still my favourite now. Easy to make.

Easy to follow,mine burnt a bit around the edges but the sauce covered the taste up a bit. It was a winner with my family giving some a dose of nostalgia, back to the old farm days.

This is a wonderful warm dish to have! I made this last year for my girl scout troop and I ended up giving the recipe to three people! We all loved it!

I think this is a lovely warm pudding for the winter. I am South African and we often had this pudding for dessert. I would use a little less sugar as it tends to be on the sweet side. Enjoy it.
