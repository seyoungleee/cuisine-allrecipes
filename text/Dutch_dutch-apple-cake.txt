This cake turned out great!  Lovely, light and very delicious!  I made a couple substitutions to it though - instead of 1/2 cup shortening I used 1/2 cup butter and I used 1 cup (packed) brown sugar instead of the white.  Also added a couple dashes of cinnamon and a few more chopped apples in the batter.

Just made this lastnight and it's practically gone already!  Will definitely make this again.

I found the dough too sweet and not stiff enough. The fruit fell right through to the bottom.

Delicious

Very good. I added more apples and crumbs

This is a family fall favorite (ONLY made during the fall)...  this recipe appeared in my Nana's old tyme books... the type when sifting 3x's was an absolute.  This recipe works, personally I add cream of tarter and you cannot have this without VANILLA SAUCE!  The warm cake and warm sauce is New England Fall at it's finest... My kids demand this from me yearly!  Thanks Nana

We loved this cake. Only thing I changed the first time I made it was brown sugar for white. But noticed no difference. Fantastic with ice cream.

The cake was very moist and had nice flavor.  My husband liked the fact that it was not overly sweet.  I just did a lite dusting of cinnamon sugar on the top.

I am normally a terrible baker, so I could not believe how amazing this turned out!  Reminded me of the apple pancake I used to get as a child at Walker Brothers on Chicagoâ€™s North Shore.  Thank you!

I made this today.  I made a double recipe and I also substituted butter for the shortening, plus I also added apple pieces to the batter..

Wonderful!

This is an excellent recipe! I made it for dessert when friends came for supper. We have lots of apples to use up , I chopped up about 3 apples and put it in the batter mix, not on top. I will be making it again and again. The cinnamon and sugar on the top is a great idea. I might try whipped cream on top next time.
Thanks for the recipe

Love this recipe!  Didn't change a thing. So moist and delicious!
