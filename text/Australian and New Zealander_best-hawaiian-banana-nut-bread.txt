full of yummy stuff but doesn't fall apart - everyone loved it!

Really good, thick bread. Cooked it for exactly 80 min and it came out soft & moist. I left out the applesauce because i didn't have any on hand and used about 3 med sized bananas. Also used Rum extract since i didn't have any coconut. Bread had good flavor, and is not a very sweet bread at all. Would be really good for breakfast with a cup of coffee. I also agree on doubling  the topping because there could of been more to cover the loaf. Also i used powdered sugar instead of white sugar for the topping.

Wonderful as is. I double the butter, sugar, milk and Macnuts for the topping because is so delicious.

This cake was very moist and heavy.  For some reason the center did not cook very well and I left it in the oven longer than needed.
