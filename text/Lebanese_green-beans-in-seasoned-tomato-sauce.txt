I liked it, Mom ate it, and hubby said ehhh. I liked the cinnamon in the mix. Not often but I will make this again.

I gave this recipe a 3 for a base recipebut made changes.  I sautéed one onion with 3-4 minced garlic with 1/4 cup olive oil.  I added a bag of frozen cut green beans ( Romano are the best but hard to find where I am). Once they change color I add a can of herbed diced tomatoes salt and pepper to taste and more cinnamon.  I also add half a can of rinsed chickpeas for protein.  Let simmer 15 mins to the flavours can meld.  You can serve this warm or have it cold just add more olive oil to your liking.

I thought this recipe was good but I left out the sugar (since that is totally unnecessary in most vegetable dishes)preboiled my beans in beef broth until about 1/2 cooked and I used my homemade tomato sauce (which includes roasted tomatoes and peppers, garlic, garlic salt, oregano and basil) which gave it that extra bit of flavor that I  thought it needed based on other's comments. I thought it was really good.

As the submitter said, she was attempting to recreate the dish, and I would say yhus is a decent attempt,  but not 100% quite there. My husband is Lebanese and This is a staple in our household. I use 2 regular sized cans of green beans, one can of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce. First saute a decent amount of onions in olive oil, then add your canned tomatoes and green beans. I season it generously with my own spice blend that I make using 1tbls. cinnamon, 1.5 tsp salt, 1 tsp nutmeg, .5 tsp black pepper and 1/4 tsp allspice.  As another reviewer suggested,  you can add lamb or ground beef as well. but we keep this vegetarian typically. I serve it over rice and vermicelli pilaf.  So delicious!!

I make this dish often with a few changes .. First brown lamb shoulder or pieces of lamb.  Add onions, brown,  and garlic.  When meat is browned add enough water to stew meat.  When meat is tender add fresh green beans,.  Season with salt and pepper. Add  tomato sauce or paste, whichever u prefer and a pinch of cinnamon.  Cook until green beans are soft and sauce has thickened.  Serve over rice.

I used canned green beans. I wasn't thrilled with the recipe to be honest.
