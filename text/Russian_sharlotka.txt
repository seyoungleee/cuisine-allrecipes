Came out great, I did add sour cream. Next time I would add lemon zest, more apples and less sugar. But overall it’s a great recipe and I’ll be making it again

I added butter and brown sugar before the apples and did not add the sour cream. It could have used the sour cream as it is a little dry.  Served with whipped cream to make up for it.

It was very good! We ate most of it as soon as it was done. I have made it many times and plan to make more.
