My son loved this!  Made the recipe as instructed, but added a bit of salt and pepper when cooking chicken, and cooked the chicken for less time, as it was already done at 25 min or so.  Next time I would add more raisins, and spice it up a bit more (my husband wanted more spice).  However, my son even wanted the leftovers for breakfast!

Time consuming, but it was an awesome change of pace from the standard boring meals. My only changes was using a full box of raisins (6oz) while still cutting the recipe in half (which is still a ton of food for 2 people). I don't care for raisins, particularly when they are cooked in to food, but they worked well in this recipe.This one is definitely a keeper.

This was absolutely delicious! I didn’t have any chickpeas, but I really wanted to get rid of some shredded chicken I had left over from another meal. I followed the rest of the instructions exactly. Don’t skip the raisins, they are a wonderful element to the dish. As I’m reviewing this, I realized I forgot to add the paprika on the top, but it still turned out absolutely amazing! People should eat this!

Turned out great. Simple and good.

Incredibly bland

I prepared it exactly as written and it’s a favorite in my house!
