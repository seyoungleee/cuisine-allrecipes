Delicious with a side of yum!

Absolutely delicious! Exactly the same as my Finnish great grandma made on her wood stove. Make a double batch, I did and my toddlers gobbled up 5 pancakes each and the 2 adults ate the rest. An extra splash of vanilla and they're perfect plain, but we also loved them with blueberry syrup.

These were such a hit at our house!  So easy to make and much healthier! I doubled the recipe exactly (made 12) and used gluten free all-purpose flour and they turned out perfect! My father in law is visiting from Italy and after making pancakes for him I found he isn't a fan of the thicker american pancake.  I told him that he would have to wait for my mother in laws French crepe as I didn't have the machine or the know how to make the thinner pancake.  Well after seeing this recipe I had to try and I am happy to say I don't need yet another appliance in the house to make crepe like pancakes! Big win for kids and adults!
