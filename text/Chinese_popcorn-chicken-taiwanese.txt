Just made this for supper and my finicky hubby polished off his portion and more, in record time, with glowing compliments! The only changes I made were: to use 2 large chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces; and to reduce salt to a pinch, as soya sauce and vinegar did the trick for our taste. Really enjoyed these crispy , flavourful morsels.  Will use this dredging method,  with tempura batter mix and different flavourings again with chicken and think it would be great with fish or shrimp as well!!
Soooo, I tried this recipe with fish [Banga Mary/Guyanese 'sea trout'] and prawns last weekend. WOW!!! Both batches were polished off before I could take photos to post on this site. Needless to say, rave reviews all round as well.

This was delicious! I used chicken breast but, otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. It was tender and juicy and tasted exactly like the popcorn chicken we get at our favorite Taiwanese restaurant in Reno. It was pretty easy to make, though we kept our oil at 350 degrees, otherwise it browned too fast. I definitely recommend this recipe!

great recipe

Excellent recipe.  I don't use the five-spice, but add fish sauce instead.  My family loves it dipped in sweet chili sauce.

so yummy
