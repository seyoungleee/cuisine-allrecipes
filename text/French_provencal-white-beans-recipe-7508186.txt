Fair amount of chopping in this recipe, but it’s worth your effort.  The only thing that I’d change next time is cutting back on the amount of chicken stock.  You simmer canned beans in chicken stock, then drain and reserve the liquid, but later on, only add back half of the stock.  So you’re left with a fair amount of unused chicken stock (with the liquid from the canned beans) which is wasteful.  I have to think, at a minimum, you could use 24 oz of chicken stock instead of 36.  Would also recommend that you don’t substitute dried herbs for the fresh, because they really do infuse incredible flavor into these beans.  Hard to believe you get this kind of flavor from canned beans.  This recipe is 5 stars all the way, it’s excellent.  Thanks for sharing.
