The cake should be baked for 40 minutes BEFORE adding the topping.  Please bake an additional 20 minutes.  Serve hot or cold.

I had to add milk to give it any texture of a cake. I added 1/2 c. milk.  If it isn't going to have a texture of batter, then you should say it instead has a texture of dough.

My family loves this cake!  My son requested it for his birthday.

Awesome cake! Wouldn't change anything.

This cake is delicious. It is great with the topping but the cake is so sweet that it's tasty without it as well.

Good. I did use a crumble topping. I wanted to use this for a coffee cake. I still prefer another recipe from this sight for apple cake. But how can you go wrong? Apples make a cake nice and moist!

Fabulous cake. I grated the apples, but otherwise did everything as directed. Will make it again.

This cake is SOOOOO GOOOOD!!! it is very important to cut the apple pieces pretty small or the cake will fall apart when you cut into it. I've made this 3 times already, and all my friends and family keep askin for more! I also tried it with dried fruit and it was very good. Thanks!
