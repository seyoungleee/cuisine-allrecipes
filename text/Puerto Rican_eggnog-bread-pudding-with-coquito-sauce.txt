This is a great recipe, when my husband has a slice, he keeps saying how good it is. Will definitely be a Holiday dessert. The only change made is I used spiced rum.

I've made this 4 times in the past month.  If you like eggnog, you're going to love this bread pudding.  I do add more bread cubes to soak up the eggnog and cinnamon.
