I am the creator of this recipe. 2 tablespoons dried does not make 2 tablespoons ground.   Here is a change that was not posted....I ground the rosemary to make 2 tablespoons ground.  Try doubling or tripling the rosemary to get 2 tablespoons.  Enjoy!

I love this recipe-smells great when you mix up a batch and tastes great on fish/chicken, etc.

SO EASY AND I ALMOST HAD EVERY INGREDIENT!

I lacked Lavender, Savory, Tarragon, and Fennel but they are on my shopping list to add to it. Also, I used a mortar and pestle as I do not have an herb grinder. As is, I used it on Steelhead Trout last night. It was MARVELOUS!

My soup recipe called for this and it tasted delish! ðŸ˜‹

I was looking for herb de provence recipe and mine was out and I didn't have any. So I made it except I didn't have savory and lavender but it turned for my Spaghetti meat sauce fantastic.

I did not add the bay powder.

Why buy store bought? I had almost all except the flower and was very good.

Great blend! Very similar, and better than, the tiny jar someone brought back from a trip to France. I didn't have marjoram so I added extra savory. I left out the lavender after reading the post that said it is never used in France. I ground the fennel, rosemary, and bay leaves in my VitaMix and then combined everything else. I'll definitely make this again!

I do not like Fennel seeds, so I left them out. I also did not use dried rosemary.
I look forward to using this blend in a recipe soon.
