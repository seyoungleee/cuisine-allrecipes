TO MAYA, YOU NEED TO ADD THE EGGS ONE AT A TIME AND MIX WELL AFTER EACH EGG AND YOU NEED TO DO IT WHILE IT STILL WARM , THE BEST WAY IS TO USE A MIXER .THIS WILL ADD AIR TO YOUR MIX JUST LIKE MAKING CREAM PUFFS.

As with many Passover foods, these fall into the "edible, but only because I must" category. They came out greasy and heavy. Maybe I did something wrong, but I was hoping for something a little lighter that I could cut open and eat with tuna. These are more like balls of scrambled eggs with matzah meal mixed in. I would recommend making 6 or 8 smaller rolls and baking a little longer. They could use a little seasoning as well; maybe onion or garlic added with the eggs. Sitting in the oven helped crisp up the outsides, and they are certainly filling, but I will look for another recipe to try next Pesach.
