I had my first Ekmek while stationed in Turkey in the Army many years ago.  This recipe is excellent but the wood fired ovens the Turks use give a different character that is impossible to match.

Enterprising young men in Turkey buy baskets of fresh loaves and sell it on extablished delivery routes.  Tenants in upper story apartments have baskets on cords or ropes that they lower from their balconies with the money and the vendor will take the money and put the loaves in for the customer to haul back up.

Very disappointed with the recipe.  The taste and texture are nothing close to any Turkish breads I have ever eaten.  And after living in Turkey for years and being married to a Turkish woman for even longer, she even questioned the Turkish in the title.  One additional note, Ekmek is the name for all breads in Turkey, it would be nice to know what kind of bread this really is...

Really nice flavor! Here’s what I did: I made the starter on Friday night. Saturday morning, I fed it again. Saturday night, I gave it the final feeding, so Sunday I could mix the dough. I used regular cool tap water in the bowl of a stand mixer, added the starter, and mixed it with a spoon to loosen it a bit. I added the flour, salt, and instant yeast (only about 11 g, or .35 ounces) and mixed with the dough hook for about 10 minutes. It’s a wet, sticky dough, but had lovely long developed gluten strands. I transferred the dough to an oiled bowl for the first proof. By the time it had doubled and I dumped it onto a floured board, the dough was firm and bouncy and a delight to work with. I sprinkled sesame seeds on the top of one loaf and baked them on a baking stone. Oh, and I preheated the oven and stone to 475, then reduced the oven temp to 425 once the loaves were in. I wish I’d had the sense to get ingredients to make döner kebaps; this bread would’ve been perfect!

I made this recipe a few years ago, the same recipe was published on turkish site Binnur turkish cookbook that I visit often. Now I am glad to see this recipe here. The taste was very good, but I think  actually there is not a big difference in taste between this bread and a traditional bread without starter. So, I used this recipe only one time because I make bread three times a week and it is complicated for me to wait four days.

I've made this a couple times now, and have made it into 1 large loaf, and baked it in a cast iron covered pot that I preheated in the oven first, 1/2 hr covered and 15 min uncovered. Chewy crust and mild sourdough flavour - yum!

Great bread, but it's kind of like an italian white bread. There is nothing flat about it! My starter was also soupy like another reviewer mentioned (both times I've made it) but that didn't seem to be a problem. However, I had to add quite a bit of flour while kneading because the dough stayed pretty sticky.  But the texture is great and my family loved it. This time I'm trying it with half whole wheat flour and a little flax oil...I'll update on how it goes! (On the second rise now, all appears to be going well)

Let me start off by saying that I am by No Means an experienced breadmaker-the extent of my knowledge comes from attempting to make a loaf of french bread about four years ago (unsuccessfully) So this recipe was a little bit of a gamble for me! and guess what? it is the most wonderful bread!!! my loaves came out of the oven about 20 minutes ago and I was in shock, my result was a wonderfully textured bread with a nice chewy, crispy crust and a wonderful fluffy center =) a few sidenotes, I substituted an unbleached all purpose flour in place of the bread flour and the result seems just fine, also the part of the recipe that says 'break starter into small pieces and drop into yeast mixture' definitely worried me because my starter wasn't breakable...it was more like flour and water soup, but the end result was still wonderful! I'm currently enjoying it with a little butter and honey on top and I don't think I'll be able to make myself pay $5 for a loaf of gourmet bread at the store ever again after knowing I can make something better by myself at home! THANK YOU SO MUCH for this recipe!

The bread is delicious.  My husband loved it....just a shame one has to wait 4 days to enjoy it but it's worth the wait.  It is not complicated at all; just have to remember to do each step each day and be able to plan ahead if you want this for a special dinner.

This is a very good recipe! We served it with Pepper Havarti cheese and it was wonderful. We make it once a month.
