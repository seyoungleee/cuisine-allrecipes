My daughter made this for her Germany Culture Project for school.  I didn't expect them to come out so well.  These were great.  I'll keep this recipe and use it again!  These were not bland at all. She cooked them for only 11 minutes and came out perfect.

My son made these for German Club and they were okay - very heavy on the honey taste - don't worry about the ginger - can hardly taste it - he followed the directions exactly and they turned out very flat -should have added more flour but was worried they would be hard. Probably won't make them again.

Really good, soft cookie.  I will probably add half tsp more ginger, maybe dash of cinnamon. Great cookie!

I just took them out of the oven,  my granddaughter loves them, very sweet.

It tastes like a soft cake-like Nilla Wafer! So making this again! Easy to make!

Very little flavor. Not worth the effort or calories.

I made these for a cookie swap. My first batch did not come out well but I liked the taste so I tweaked it to make it work. I added 1t cinnamon to Step 2. I put the batter in the fridge for about 2 hours before cooking. Then rolled balls and rolled balls in sugar putting on cookie sheet (using parchment paper) and pushed balls slightly down.  I also added powered sugar after cooling

I tried this recipe today.I won’t make it again. I couldn’t get it to taste right no matter what I tried.

Amazing recipe my family loved it but I had to add it a little more of flour

I followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was very bland;  I will not make it again, nor do I recommend it.

First time making cookies at all and I have to say, the recipe is easy to do and the result is surprising, I even altered the recipe and it still came out right, going full honey no sugar and all butter no shortening, added a little more powdered ginger and vanilla extract, the result was delicious, if a tad too sweet for my taste. I still definitely recommend it.
