I also add one or two tart sliced apples.

Made recipe as is.  We totally didn't like the flavours and found it dry and bland.

My husband and I liked this recipe.  I made it according to the directions except I added a cut up green apple like somebody suggested.   I also browned it first.  I cooked it on low.  It was done after 4 hours.

no changes, it was ok, not great

This smelled fantastic and we were looking forward to dinner. But it was sweet and bland. We tried adding apple cider vinegar, more salt, more pepper, jalapeno juice, and tabasco but nothing improved the flavor. I ended up throwing it all in the trash. If I ever make it again, I won't add the brown sugar and I won't rinse the sauerkraut.

Made this for New Yearâ€™s Day and family loved it

Very easy recipe, i would ha e liked more flavor and I would definitely add so other seasoning to it

If you like sauerkraut, this is a great dish. The pork was very tender and the juice on the bottom of the crockpot  was tasty.   I added some chopped apples as suggested by another reviewer.    This is a keeper!

Made with 1/2 bottle Angry Orchard hard cider and put the other half to good use washing it down later :-)

Started later in the day, cooked on low for 4 hours, and on high for the final hour. Perfect.

Excellent!
