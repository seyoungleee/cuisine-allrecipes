This cake is tastes like fluffy nutella. Yum. It puffs up a lot, even though there isn’t any baking powder. Light and delicious, it goes very well with tea or coffee.

I made this cake twice, one day apart, exactly as the recipe states.  It is delicious, and had a wonderful nutty texture and hazelnut flavor.  I am giving it four stars because both times I baked it, it was not done at one hour.  The first one fooled me with the toothpick test and when I removed it from the pan, it was like a lava cake!  Hence my making it a second time . And yes, the second time was baked through, and took 1 hour 15 at 350. It is a delightful cake!
Thank you for sharing the recipe!
