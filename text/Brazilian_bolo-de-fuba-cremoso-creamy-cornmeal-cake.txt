It was just ok, nothing memorable about it.  I could not taste the cornmeal nor the Parmesan cheese. It had a custard like center with the top of the cake (which was the bottom, once inverted) baking into a thin cake-like crust. It took 43 minutes to bake.

Made it with Cream Cheese and it came out excellent,  substituting 4 oz. Cream cheese for the Parmesan and I added about 1/2 teaspoon of orange marmalade and 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice.

I made it and I should have trusted my instincts, I baked at 300 Fahrenheit for over an hour and it was not Browning. I changed to 350 and cooked for another 15 minutes. I decided to take it out and the whole bottom of it was raw. The recipe was definitely too liquid. It did not work

Blew up out of the pan. All the custard spilled out everywhere. Maybe if the pan size was bigger it would have worked, I'm not sure.

I am moving so looking for recipes to use up supplies; this one fit the bill.  Following the recipe, this was more like SOUP.  Therefore I added all my flour, cornmeal, coconut, parmesan, and a cup more sugar until I got the right texture.  This filled three cake tins.  I raised the temperature to 350 and added 5 minutes.  The cakes cooked into a great sponge.  Making a pourable custard-like mascarpone cheese, this was a BIG hit.  This recipe, with my additions, resulted in a great sponge and used most of my supplies.
