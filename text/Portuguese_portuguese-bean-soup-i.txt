This soup was delicious. I used a chicken-based chorizo sausage to reduce the amount of fat.

Yummy !!!! I made this as written with no changes except for only having  knackwurst sausages on hand and added 1/2 t  Bay seasoning  only with salt and pepper.....

Love this!

Love it. I used 1 scant Tbsp cayenne pepper though.

Great flavor, but WAY too much heat! I used less than a tablespoon of cayenne, and we still had to tame it down with some sour cream. I'll happily make this again, but...live and learn.

I think 1 1/2 Tbsp cayenne pepper must have been a mistake in the original recipe. I recommend possibly 2 tsp. I also added more kidney beans and kale.

Delicious!! I was very pleasantly surprised- I wasn't expecting such full on flavour, at least more than just spicy, but it was very flavourful. The spice was not overpowering. I did change the recipe slightly to fit what I had on hand- I did not add celery, and the spice I used was a paprika/cayenne mix. I also added crushed chilies. I cooked the chorizo on a grill pan which added a nice 'grilled' smokey flavour. Was not an expensive meal either, and easy to make, so this will become part of my normal rotation!

Excellent!

My entire family loved this!  This is going on my winter rotation.

This is such a tasty soup! My kids and I absolutely loved it, however, I ommitted the celery but it still came out great, tastes like chilli!
