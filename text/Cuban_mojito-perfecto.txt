A pleasant minty cocktail that’s so refreshing for a hot summer’s day.  I didn’t have lemon-flavored rum, so I substituted lemon seltzer water for the soda water.  I also used extra mint leaves as a personal preference.

I thought this was a great recipe.

Easy and quick! I let the mint and limes soak in the rum a few minutes before adding the ice and soda.

I added a tiny bit more sugar since my lime was extra big. Otherwise I stayed true to the recipe. Very nice flavor on this warm day!

We use dark rum and fresh mint from the garden. Good and strong. Also find that making each glass to order is thee only way. Using a shaker or to attempt a pitcherful...NO!

needs more mint leaves

This was really good, and I don't generally like alcohol! Couldn't find lemon rum so I made it with lemon liqueur and I enjoyed it.

I made this about 5 times amount in a large jug for friends. Was a big hit. Also hits you hard after a few of them.

Yummy! Followed the recipe but I didn't have club soda so I used tonic water and squeezed half a lime in each glass with lots of crushed fresh lime from my garden. So so good!

Delightfully delicious! Will make again and again.
