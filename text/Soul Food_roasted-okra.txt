Mercy me, these were delicious.  I cut a few okra up, splashed a little olive oil in the bowl, sprinkled a little seasoning salt on them, tossed and spread in a pan along side sliced zucchini.  I rarely fry foods, so this was a terrific substitute for fried okra.  Keep in mind that the longer you cook it, the smaller it shrinks, so what you think will serve four could end up being barely enough for 2.

So slimy!  And I tried the suggestion to soak them in water and a ton of lime juice too!  Maybe I am just not an okra person...

Yummy!

Horrible. Super stringy and inedible.

Easy and simple. How do you get any better than that?

This was very good.  Baked it in cast iron pan.  Used "everything" seasoning rather than other seasonings.

I didn’t put nearly the amount of salt.  I sprinkled it with nature’s seasoning and I like it cooked longer so probably 25 minutes to make it crunchy/chewy

I know when cooking any okra, except fried. You need to add  a cut up tomato or some white vinegar, to cut the slime Something acid. Like when you smother okra in a cast iron skillet you need to add a tomato or a little white vinegar .  I made this and tossed the okra, oil, and a little vinegar in a bowl, before cooking. It was good and crispy..

Wow!  Easy-Peasy!   I used a bag of pre-chopped, frozen okra.  Did not thaw them.  Tossed them in a bowl with olive oil, kosher salt, pepper and a sprinkle of pepper flakes.  Roasted them for 40 minutes.  They were PERFECT!!!!   Thank you!

Fantastic simple recipe. Fabulous. I used up air fryer instead of oven. Worked great.

Tastes great!!!
