Hash browns are shredded. These aren’t hash browns.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and used “Taco Seasoning 1” from allrecipes. I didn’t  have fresh jalapeños so I rinsed some pickled jalapeño slices, removed the seeds and used those. This will be a weekly rotation or more for us, it was that good! My air fryer is an instant pot with an air fryer lid.
