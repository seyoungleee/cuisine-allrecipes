Exactly like the Hummingbirds in Jamaica. Hint: for the Strawberry syrup, you can use one found with the pancake syrups.

I'm on the fence about this one. This has got to be one of the most interesting cocktails I've ever had. I made no substitutions, I had to use half of a FROZEN banana only because I had no ice. Different. Very different.

Delicious ðŸ˜‹

I love this drink.  I can't wait to go back to Jamaica to get the coconut cream rum.  This makes such a difference in the drink.  Malibu doesn't work.

What a fun and unexpected combinations of ingredients that came together in a way I totally did not expect.  I had some strawberry liquor I used instead of a syrup.  It's like a grownup milkshake that's great on a warm afternoon.

I followed the recipe exactly and the ladies I made it for loved it.   It's a really nice thick consistency.   Perfect for those beach chair days.

Nice flavor, a little too sweet with too little of a kick for my taste. For all of you saying that you cannot find Rum cream it's basically RumChata which is an excellent substitute.

HAVE NOT TRIED THIS RECIPE YET, BUT IT SEEMS TO BE THE EXACT INGREDIENTS I ENJOYED IN JAMAICA EVERYDAY LAST WEEK.  :). I TOO PURCHASED THE RUM CREAM WHILE IN JAMAICA, WAS NOT A FAN OF COFFEE LIQUEUR SO I ALWAYS HAD THEM TO OMIT, BUT I AM GOING TO TRY MAKING IT WITH AMARETTO.  NEED TO PURCHASE THE SYRUP AND BANANA AND I WILL REPORT BACK MY FINDING.  ONE OTHER THING, IN JAMAICA MY BARTENDER GREGORY WHO SAID HIS GRANDFATHER WAS THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS DRINK ALSO ADDS TWO DARK RUMS AND ONE LIGHT RUM TO THE MIX(POTENT0 BUT YOU DON'T TASTE THE LIQUOR AT ALL!

This recipe definitely makes me want to go to Jamaica! I used Rum Chata cream rum. It was pretty easy to find. This is a must try!

Yum.  We start our Jamaican vacation with one of these,  and end it the same way.

This drink takes me back to the Bahamas, in a good way! Love it!
