This recipe is certainly tastey, but not exactly how it is made in Perú. While living there I've always seen it made with Pisco, I don't remember whether it was lemon or lime, sugar, and blended with egg whites to make the foam on top. plus a tiny spot of bitters on top.

Easy & delish.

Tasty drink!
