The recipe is good as is. I think they are supposed to be more creppe-like. I suggest using a mandolin with small Julianne setting so the pancakes cook more evenly.  You can also grate the apple but make sure to squeeze it out to remove the excess water.

As is, the ratio of liquids to solid ingredients is terrible. Batter basically needs an extra cup of flour to not be crepe-like, and the apples need to be diced very small. After adding extra flour the pancakes were ok, but not very fluffy or flavorful. I'd add more baking powder and slat, as well as cinnamon to add some flavor.

I substituted half the milk with apple cider and added little oil to the batter...these had a great apple taste.  Served with some warm maple syrup for a more traditional pancake breakfast.

Made it this morning. Used 1 cup of buttermilk (because I had some)and about 3/4 cup milk. My first time having Polish pancakes. Eggier than pancakes I normally make but nonetheless tasty. The powered sugar is all you need to top it. Delicious. Tried some maple syrup on top and didn't enjoy it with it. Thank you for the recipe.

They are perfect, I made double and they disappeared in a  few minutes.

I will make it again but use less milk. Batter was too watery, causing the pancake to cook before apples softened.

These pancakes were awesome! My Omi used to make these, she called them apple fritters. I used 4 small Empire apples as they were not good for eating anymore but great for cooking. I did need to add a few extra tbsps of flour as the batter was a bit thin. I ate them with icing sugar but my sons had homemade maple syrup from our neighbours farm.
