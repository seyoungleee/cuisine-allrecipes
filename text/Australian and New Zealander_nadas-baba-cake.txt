My cake seemed a little on the dry and crumbly side so I will have to adjust it a touch by adding a little more oil next time or even by reducing the baking time. I baked it 40 mins but as with all baking, variations are to be considered due to different ovens etc etc. Otherwise a lovely cake from Nada! Thanks!

Followed all the suggestions of the previous reviewers, plus I reduced the baking time to 35 minutes.  Was a bit dry.  Overall was a hassle to have to keep referring to the reviews to get it right.  Glad I did though.

I followed the other reviewer's suggestions - added 1/4 cup milk (equivalent to 4 tbsps) and 1/2 tsp. baking powder. Turned out perfect. And I used vanilla essence & regular granulated sugar. I mixed tbsp. cocoa powder with 1/4 cup of the batter, then added little bit by little bit more batter till I got a thick viscous pouring consistency. Then, I poured the main batter into the tube mould, then swirled the cocoa mixture by the spoonfuls all around. Came out of the oven with a nice swirl design :)

I am giving this 4 stars because I made several changes based on the previous review.  First, I used 1/4 c vegetable oil, regular granulated sugar, and instead of vanilla sugar, I used 1 tsp vanilla extract. I also added 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/4 c. applesauce, and a few tablespoons of milk (but I didn't measure it exactly).  I was happy with the result:  it was a dense cake and not dry. I did not alter the baking time.  I should mention also that I had a hard time getting a desired 'marble' effect.  Perhaps, it would be better to swirl the two batters together and then pour into the pan.
