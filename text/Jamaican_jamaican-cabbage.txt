When I lived in South Florida, I would stop by a Jamaican food truck about 2 times per month. This lady made the best goat curry, jerk chicken, roti. I was especially fond of her cabbage salad. I could taste the ginger and asked her if she used any. She said that was the only way she'd make it and that was why hers was the best! If I asked, she'd throw in some extra chopped habanero for me. It was absolutely fantastic! So now when I make Jamaican cabbage salad, I always add ginger and lots of habanero. Too bad, I moved and found out she'd passed away. I don't even remember her name. RIP

I subbed a habenero pepper for the Scotch bonnet pepper, as I couldn't find one in my local grocery store. The texture was nice, but the flavor was kind of bland. We added Sriracha sauce for an extra kick.

I think the bell pepper might’ve thrown this off for me. I love sautéed cabbage with just butter, salt, and pepper, and for some reason this didn’t hit me right.

This is very good but I thought could use some more spice.

Next time I need to add more salt but other than that everyone loved it.

Loved this recipe. Great taste and pretty easy to make. Great side dish and compliment to some great jerk chicken. Give it a try.

Wonderful.  A couple of adjustments.  I added fresh ginger, used poblano pepper, no green onions and red bell pepper.

Very good. And easy to make.

This recipe is pretty good but I make a few tweaks to it as I feel something is missing. I add more salt and sugar both to taste as well as a teaspoon of ginger and a tablespoon of curry powder. Pairs extremely well with jerk chicken and beef patties!

I have made this two times and it is excellent. It’s a quick and delicious dish.

Very good flavor. We had it with pork. This is a keeper.
