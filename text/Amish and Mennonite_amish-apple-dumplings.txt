Delicious. Was wanting a Lancaster County tasting apple dumpling and this did the trick! Only change was used butter instead of shortening.

Very easy to make and very tasty. Added some vanilla ice cream and YUUUUMMMMMY!!!

These are amazing!! I also used butter instead of shortening. I doubled this because I had 12 apples but really the only part that needed doubled was the dough. Everything else would have been fine with the amounts listed. I had a lot of both the cinnamon sugar and the syrup left over. All in all fabulous recipe just like I wanted them!
