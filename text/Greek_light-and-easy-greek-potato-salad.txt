This is very light as said. Very good falvor and a nice change from a mayo or mustard potatoe salad. I actually like this a lot better than the mayo. I did add a little more garlic/onion poweder and a touch more olive oil. Very tasty. Will def. make this again!

Needs more flavor.

Very good recipe and easy to make.  As reviewers said, it is a much lighter potato salad, which I prefer.  I didn't put it in the freezer, but I put a small bag of ice on top of the potatoes to cool them down.  Worked well.  Next time, I plan on making more of the dressing as I like a bit extra.

Nice and easy potato salad. When making the dressing, I added all the spices and herbs to my vinegar/lemon juice mixture, waited 20 minutes or so, then added the olive oil.  I think this method brings out the taste of the spices better.Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Light, yummy and a pleasure to make. Two changes: I didn’t have green onions so used yellow. Also, did a copycat version of red wine vinegar (white vinegar and red wine). Several young people in our family don’t like mayo, so this version was perfect. Next time I’ll use green onions for color as much as anything. Two thumbs up!

8-29-22 I did not put this in the freezer. Let the potatoes cool, sliced them then added dressing. Heated up in microwave. My opinion, Germain potato salad must be served hot. This was a delicious side dish with my chicken dish,

I subbed white balsamic for the red wine vinegar, and omitted the rosemary.  Served at room temperature and was fabulous!

No changes. Great

very good I will make again and try feta cheesse with it .

Very good!  Next time a pinch less red wine vinegar.

Great side dish, the only thing is I cut potatoes to 6 instead of 12 and added a pinch more salt.
