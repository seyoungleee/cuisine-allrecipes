I remember having Maizcena (correct spelling) when I was a kid at my grandmother's but I don't remember the taste or if I liked it. Having said that, I liked this pudding. It was easy to make and it came together a lot quicker than the specified times.

My daughter wanted a Puerto Rican dish to share at school with her presentation on Puerto Rico, so we made a 4x batch & the cook times were as described in the recipe.  I also made a 1/2 batch using rice milk instead of cow milk, due to a classmate allergy, and it cooked up MUCH faster than the recipe states.  I would agree with the other comment that says the recipe cooks faster than described - smaller batches thicken faster.  My advice is that you have the egg yolks ready to go, so that once you see the pudding beginning to thicken you can do that step.Also, it doesn't specifically say to stir constantly, but if you don't the milk mixture will begin to stick to the bottom of the pan & potentially burn.

Simple and easy to make. I will make this again.

Easy and delicious! My family loves this recipe and I love that they get so much calcium from it. It does set very firm, but we like pudding like that (much better than not setting and being loose).
