Very easy to make and a big hit! Delicious will make again!

Any substitute for the nuts? I can't eat nuts but this cake sounds really good.

Incredible! My favorite go to cake.

It was good just reminded me more of banana nut bread

This is the most excellent cake Iâ€™ve ever baked!  Moist, perfect crumb, dense; I changed nothing.  The edges have a nice slight crust, perfect with coffee or tea.

Made this as cupcakes. It made two dozen. Everyone liked them. Thanks for something to do with bananas that's not banana bread.

This is so good! It tastes a bit like a cross between a carrot cake and banana bread. I had to omit the pecans due to a nut allergy but it was still delicious. And I did use all of the icing/frosting! :D

This is one of the best cakes ever! I like the lighter cream cheese icing because the cake is sweet enough. I love the fact that it is super simple to throw together but the taste says otherwise! Thank you Chef!

absolutely fantastic!
