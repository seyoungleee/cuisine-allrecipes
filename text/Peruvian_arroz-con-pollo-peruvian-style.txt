It was yummy but just too much rice for the amount of other ingredients, I suggest adding only 2 cups unless you add more of the other and also adding an extra cup of broth or beer

The recipe was easy to follow and it turned out great, but I’ve made this maybe 6 times now using this recipe and it always takes much longer than the 20 minutes to cook the rice at the end. I have an electric stove, so maybe my low setting is too low. I don’t know.

What a wonderful recipe, combining two staples for a wonderful budget meal.  I did not use the beer, used chicken brouth for the rice plus a little water.  The reason I did not give this a 5 star is that it did not mention removing the skin if you are using a whole chicken, a must.  This will be made many times.

Looked great so it inspired me to do something fun. I made it with egg noodles instead of rice, added some spice via jalapeno slices, touch of chili powder as well as cumin. A few tbs of water in the sauce with teaspoon of cornstarch to give the noodles a thicker coating of juice.  Add peas last to the sauce and then add it all to the finished noodles.

This worked well. I followed Nina Vega's advice and used only 2 cups of rice and added an extra cup of liquid (I used chicken stock). I topped the dish with Peruvian aji sauce (Inka Mama's Aji, from this site) and it really complimented the dish well. Good taste and easy to make. Thanks for sharing!

My DH grilled the chicken separately so I used chicken stock instead of drippings. I added jalapeños to the mix for a little extra heat.
