I made recipe, but added  1 tsp.  Baking powder. 
The dough turned out to be just a little bit more flaky, which I really liked.  Other than that  it's  a great  recipe.

They are great from scratch but takes a bit of time, I also find the frozen empanada wrappers fine but it's fun and of course cheaper to make your own. One thing I would add is that if you refrigerate them for longer than 30 minutes, the dough gets softer and easier to work with.

very good taste. I had to add a bit more water than the 6 tbsps. Maybe my flour was drier than normal, but 6  just wasn't enough! I put a little guava paste and a bit of goat cheese into each empanada ........ Delicious!

Simple and came out perfect for my empanadas.

I would like to make a suggestion. Use lentles and vegetables for  a vegetarian filling

quick, easy to make, easy to work with. made 12 "discs" with re-rolling scraps after cutting. so fast I am about to make another batch now.

I used this recipe for my first ever attempt at empanadas. Turned out great exactly as written! Kids loved them too. Thank you for sharing.

The dough was really good, i did have to add more water to make it come together.
