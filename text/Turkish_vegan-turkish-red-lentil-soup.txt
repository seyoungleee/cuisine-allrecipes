Great recipe. I made a few changes such as,  I halved the salt to just 1 tsp. I used Laural the bay I have growing in my garden. I have a food intolerance to tomatoes so I used 1/2  of a mango & molasses.
Thank you.

I love getting red lentil soup when out at Mediterranean restaurants and I’ve been looking for a way to make it at home. This soup hit the spot! I now keep the ingredients on hand and make it at least once a month. The only change I made was to cut the salt in half. Delicious!!

Great recipe.  Cut back on the salt.  I added celery and carrots which everyone enjoyed.

I used celery instead of onion since I can’t eat onion and added some brown rice. Will definitely be making again. And I left out the curry.

Didn’t blend it as suggested.

It was delicious.  I wanted it hot so I added some hot stuff and used yellow instead of red lentils.  Yum!

We liked this. I did not add the two cups of water at the end -- it was intensely flavored and we did not think it needed to be diluted. We will make this again. The only thing I would change is that I would leave out the second teaspoon of salt. EDITED TO ADD: Based on another recipe I recently tried, I might garnish this with cilantro instead of parsley.

Great as is, complex flavours yet simple to assemble.  Get thicker when served the next day, yummy and healthy.

Really tasty soup. Tend to stay away from things vegan but this was well worth the break-out. Will be making it again
