I made this as to the recipe, I could not get white eggplant so I used regular. I salted the eggplant to avoid bitterness, and should have rinsed it off as the oyster sauce has a lot of sodium but it was still AWESOME!!!!. If you like Viet. food or eggplant you must try this. I should have doubled this as we wanted more and there was just the 2 of us. I served this with Viet. vermacelli bowls also found on Allrecipes.com It was a perfect paring.

Really delicious. Used purple eggplant and lemon juice instead of lemongrass. Topped with cilantro.
