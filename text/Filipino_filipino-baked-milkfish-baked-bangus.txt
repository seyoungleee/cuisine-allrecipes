I've never made Filipino food before and this was also my 1st time making milk fish. I found the number of bones to be ridiculous. I purchased a whole one (frozen) and was alarmed to find it had not been scaled or gutted.  Be prepared to have scales everywhere!  I substituted the juice of a large lemon instead of calamansi but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  The recipe has interesting asian notes and have never had tomato or onion stuffed fish but found it refreshingly different.  I would make again but with a different fish, maybe tilapia or similar.  Hint: Be sure to use tin foil wider than the standard 12" width to get a good seal.

Sarap po ng luto nyo. Nagustuhan ng mga bata. Suggestion ko lang po sana wag na imperial units ang gamitin natin metric nalang po. Hindi na po dapat ginagamit ang imperial units kasi outdated na. Salamat po
