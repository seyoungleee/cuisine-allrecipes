To give this salad a little "kick", I added a dash of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. I did not add the full amount of salt and pepper, I added it to taste. I made this around noon today as to give it time to sit in the dressing until dinner. VERY good, though my husband and I thought this needed more dressing. Next time, I will double the dressing ingredients.

I made this to go with a Japanese chicken dish, because I had half a head of cabbage to use.  I was out of scallions, which would have helped a lot, and I chose not to bother with the almonds.  I added two shredded carrots, did use the garlic, and used only 1/2 tsp pepper. Not bad, but the sesame oil was too overpowering.  I ended up using another Tbsp each of sugar and vinegar to try to counteract the oil.  If I make it again, will use 1 T. sesame oil and 1 T. canola, with the same amt. of other ingredients.

I have been searching for a salad dressing that I experienced at "Origins;" a "Fusion" type restaurant and I would add a Carrot (Finely ground to  a paste) to yours and I will try the recipe, Thanks for sharing, Vinnie

Nothing remotely close to cabbage salads eaten in a Japan. Sesame oil overpowered the entire dish. Tossed it.

I enjoyed this light and easy cabbage salad. I used shredded red and green cabbage, added cilantro, and used sliced almonds in place of toasted seseme seeds. Served this alongside chicken tonkatsu, jasmine rice, and Vermont curry.

An all right flavor.

I halved everything in the recipe, and the sesame oil was so overpowering, it was inedible. I love bold flavors, and I cook Japanese dishes 3-4 nights a week, so it's not down to an unfamiliarity with the ingredients. I think the proportions are just way off.

This easy Cabbage Salad was so easy and really refreshing. This is a great side dish for any meal, especially one with sesame or ginger flavors. It was flavorful and will be a good summer salad to make.

Super simple and very tasty! I used all the 'optional' ingredients. The family liked this for a change from the normal slaw. I  thought it could actually use a bit of spice, like maybe some jalape√±o or hot chili oil or something. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing

This Japanese-Style Cabbage Salad was incredible! The crunchy cabbage paired really well with the refreshing sesame dressing. We enjoyed this recipe so much that I already made it a second time this week!
