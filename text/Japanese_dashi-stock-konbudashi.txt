What can I use to replace bonita flakes

Great starter for any Asian recipe. Add ingredients of your liking for a delicious soup. I followed it to the letter of the recipe for a perfect stock. Itâ€™s important not to boil the seaweed, or it will get bitter and slimy.

This recipe is so simple and so elegant. Just a couple ingredients and water, it's all about technique for delicious flavor. Sometimes I don't use bonito, and make the stock with just dashi kombu

Very easy recipe, yielded perfect dashi. Wouldn't change a thing.

Perfect. I made the best miso soup out of this base.

Good

Excellent! Don't be afraid of adding the full amount of bonito flakes. It lends a smokey fish flavor to the stock that makes all the difference. Used this as the base for the Nabeyaki Udon soup that is on this site.

What can I use to replace bonita flakes

Easy to make. I used dried kelp knot instead.

This is the base for miso soup (among other recipes) and is what makes the soup so good!  Thank you for the easy recipe!
