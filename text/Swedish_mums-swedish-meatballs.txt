Followed the recipe - very delicious. I see what some cooks mentioned about the meatballs being a little mushy, but just be gentle with them, they will be tender and not taste like something from the grocery store freezer, LOL! I served them with buttered wide egg noodles.

Followed recipe but baked in oven and they were great

Very tasty, but remember you are making meatballs so don't over add liquid ingredients to the ground beef because then it won't be able to hold the meatball form (yes, speaking from experience).  If you do, you'll be having Swedish Sloppy Joe (which also isn't bad).

I loved the flavor of these. My suggestion is to cut the stock down to 2 cups (I used three and it was a little too much), to brown the meatballs by baking them in the oven in a Pyrex on a light bed of oil, and to consider using a 3:1 mix of beef and Turkey

I didn’t make the meatballs, already had frozen on hand. But the gravy/sauce this recipe made is worth the 5 stars. At first I didn’t think it was going to thicken up enough, but after letting it sit for about 15 mins it was perfect. Will definitely be making this again.

Gave the gravy a try with some frozen meatballs I had already made from a different recipe.  I did not care for it, unlike others here.  Thanks though.

We loved this! I substituted ground turkey for the meatballs with great results!  I did put a little less milk in the meatball mixture because turkey meatballs are a little softer anyway.  I also omitted allspice because I hate cloves but I didn't think it was missing a thing!

I followed  closely as possible. I added cardamom instead of lemon pepper. So good!

I made this for my husband who is of Swedish ancestry,  I added about 1 cup of sour cream to gravy- he LOVED it! Excellent recipe~

I used heavy cream instead of the evaporated milk, left out the wine and used all ground beef.
It was delicious!
