Itâ€™s one of the better Sfouf recipe I found online. Made it twice already with only one cup of sugar and 3 tsp Turmeric. It tastes delicious. 
My only problem is that when I mix it it has the consistency of dough rather then cake batter and once baked it comes out doughy in the center even though I baked it for almost an hour the last time.
