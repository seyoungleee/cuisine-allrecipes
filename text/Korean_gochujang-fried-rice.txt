The 4cups + vegetables ratio is too much food for only 4T of sauce. I only added 2 cups rice & still needed so much more of the sauces. Also make sure to cook the rice separately from the vegetables. Easy to miss "precooked" in ingredients when recipe just says "add rice". I added vegetarian stir-fry sauce for added flavor, a cabbage mixture & peas to make this a filling entree.
