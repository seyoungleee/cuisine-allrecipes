I really loved this recipe!   I only made a couple of changes; added few extra bay leaves (dried), extra peppercorns and added a teaspoon of fennel seeds in place of the coriander.  I changed the proportion of vinegar:sugar a little, cutting back on the vinegar - and thought it was a little too sweet at first, but found that the vinegar seemed more pronounced the next day.  A friend made the same recipe & put in the whole amount of vinegar, finding it a little too acidic, so it might be an idea to just add 1 & 1/2 cups.  On a whole, there was so much flavour in this!  All you need is soft bread to soak up the marinade - it's so good.

This reminded me of my Nans recipe and Easter weekends with her. I put a teeny bit less sugar and vinegar in, but that's just to my taste. Otherwise it's a GREAT recipe. Thank you! xx

My family absolutely loves the recipe. I however added less white wine vinegar and added a bit more water. This time I split the vinegar between red whine and white wine vinegar and used less but added some plain white vinegar and water. I also used different kinds of fish. I used cod or canned tuna (my favourite) and the last 2 times I used yellowfish that we caught.

Thank you so much for the recipe, I have not eaten this for over 15 yrs. I finally did this on my own and my guest liked it too. To me it tasted leek home. I miss home & always thought I’ll ask my mom to make it but now I can make it. 💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽

My cod filets might have been a bit on the thin side, because during the cooking step they started to flake apart, so it wasn't possible to "layer" exactly the way the recipe described, and I got a little confused on how to execute. It still turned out good though. My husband didn't like it nearly as much as I did, so it could be a polarizing dish - if you like vinegary, tangy foods you will love it.

I used less vinegar and more water, use fish Masala instead of curry

This recipe was so easy to follow, I made my very own pickle fish this year, I usually go to my parents house! This makes me a grown woman now

Excellent recipe. Tip: if you need it same day, fry the fish 2 minutes each side, set aside and pour the curry/pickle sauce* in the pan and bring to a light simmer and place the fish back in, spooning sauce over the fish.  Let it all low poach for 5 minutes. * a dash or two of Peri Peri or Tabasco sauce works well if you don't have a red chile pepper.

I grew up in Cape Town and so Cape Malay Pickled Curry is a dish that I am well acquainted with and I expect it to be "just right"...  this recipe did it!  It tasted even better on the second day once the sugar and vinegar had a chance to work their pickling magic.

My husband is from Cape Town and loves pickled fish!  Perfect lunch with bread and green salad.  I've made this 2x -- first time exactly as written and 2nd time with a few changes.  It seems to me that in the Cape, pickled fish is lightly battered and fried. I wanted to cut down on the oil and fat  so rather than frying the fish, I grilled it under the broiler until just cooked.  I like the sauce as written, except I agree that the vinegar was a bit much.  I used 1 1/2 cups and thought that was still a bit strong.  I think I should have upped the brown sugar a bit to balance the flavor.
