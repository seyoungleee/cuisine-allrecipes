Way too much sugar and not much flavor.  I doubled the vanilla, added a pinch of salt, and about 2 tsp. Espresso powder.

This was way too sweet and the recipe needs to be flushed out a bit more for the newer cooks.  It is quick and simple.  If I make it again, I would cut the sugar down by half, maybe more.  I really appreciated finding a recipe that I could make without cornstarch.

It was way to sweet. Next time I make it I will only use one cup of sugar instead of the two cups. It was easy to make
