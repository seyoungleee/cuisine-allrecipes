OMG these are so addictive. I used tofu and mushrooms instead of shrimp. Simply fresh and delicious! I used superfine Thai white rice flour as well as brown rice flour. Both times I needed a bit more water, but with the brown rice I needed about one whole cup of water. I had to use soy instead of fish sauce due to allergies.

This recipe is pretty close to how I make it. I've been making this for over 50 years after learning from my Vietnamese sister-in-law. A few things seem to be missing - fresh mint, cucumber, and Nuoc Cham sauce for serving. We also always used red leaf lettuce instead of plain lettuce. The crepe itself is pretty much the same as how we always made it. It's always been my favorite dish especially in the summer!

My partner is Vietnamese and loved how these turned out! A couple of quick notes: we refrigerated the batter for several hours before making. This helped a lot. Also recommend doubling the batter, otherwise this only makes a few very thin crepes.

I made the mistake of buying glutinous rice flour  and the crepes did not work! The batter turned into a mushy ball. Make sure you buy regular rice flour.

Having eaten this for years it is easily one of my all time favorite top 5 foods. Don't worry about the crepe mixture being too thin, the ingredients are spot on. Just make sure you only add a thin layer to the pan. Be sure to read the 'Cooks Notes' since this is a very versatile recipe. Adding the pork to the shrimp really ups the recipe.  My Vietnamese is a bit rusty but Banh Xeo translates to sizzling cake or in this case sizzling crepes.
