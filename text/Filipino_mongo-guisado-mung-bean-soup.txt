wow.  this brings back memories of my lolo's cooking.  this was his ultimate comfort food specialty.  he never used prawns but he added slices of ginger and/or ampalaya.  i think the prawns make a wonderful complement.

i ate it, but was not really into it...

Great soup. Nice and hearty. I found it a little bland on the first day and at first rated this 4 stars. But then I found over the next few days the flavours had melded and it is really delicious! I'll be making this again. A great way to use mung beans :)

I will definitely make this again. It tasted wonderful! I added twice the prawns and twice the pork, otherwise, I followed the instructions as-is. I served it with rice. Wonderful!

Fabulous just as written

Did not make any changes and yes I will make it again.

This soup makes a substantial meal type of soup and is wholesome.  It is delicious and easy to make.  Recommend for autumn and winter to warm the cockles of your hearts.

Used vegetable oil instead of olive oil. Added moringa leaves. 

Added 2 cups of chicken broth because my kids love soup. Yum!

This is just awful.  The color is unappealing and the aroma is not appealing either.

It all went in to the compost bin.

Taste Great! I used chicharong baboy as replacement to pork.

Instead of pork, we used  extra firm tofu. We also added a TSBP of fish sauce to give it a little more flavor. Delicious!
