Great recipe.  Easy, quick, cheap, and adaptable.  Made as directed.  Tasted great.  Added some liquid smoke to the leftovers - even better!

This was easy, quick, and tasted great.

Tasted great. No changes made.

Loved this recipe will make it again, think I will add sausage next time.

Easy to boot!  Added some chopped chipped beef slices, as suggested by Chef John, and sautéed with the onion/pepper mixture.  Also increased the # of bacon slices.  So pretty with green avocados on top and sliced oranges on the side.  Great flavors and it's something different to break the monotony.  Would be quick to make on a work night.

Yum. Didn’t make any changes.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. I saw it in the Allrecipes magazine and had to immediately make it. Very quick and easy. Really nice way to spruce up black beans. I had a yellow pepper instead of green so I used that instead. It did provide some nice color. Other than that, followed recipe exactly...came out great.

Great quick and easy dish. I’ve made it multiple times in just one month!

I made this dish for some girls that came to the US from Brazil a few weeks ago. They loved it and told me it was just like how their grandma makes it! It has now became the favorite way my husband and I make beans!
