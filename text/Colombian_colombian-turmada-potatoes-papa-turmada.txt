Very tasty and pretty easy to make. I suggest using a bit more onion, tomato, and green onion, maybe double the recipe. I liked the addition of the bread, might even add a bit more next time.

I made for a themed dinner party and these turned out pretty good for a change. I am not sure I would make these for every day dinner though.

Excellent

This was a good recipe but I felt like the proportions of ingredients was a little off.  I used about a half pound of pork sausage instead of the links and probably doubled the amount of onion asked for and it didn't cover the pan very well.  The only thing I had more that enough of was potatoes.  Other than that it tasted really good, especially with some salsa on top.  We're looking forward to eating the leftovers for lunch.

Nicely seasoned and very simple to make this dish. Leftovers were good also. I used a mild italian pork sausage so there was lots of meat to go around. I am not sure though what the purpose of the bread was in this dish since it was not a lot.
