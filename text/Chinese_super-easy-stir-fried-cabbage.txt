Okay, I was a little wierded out by the thought of eating straight cabbage, but this dish is amazing! I also tried it with apple cider vinegar in place of the wine, and it's great either way.

We enjoy stir-fried/sauteed cabbage, but we thought the seasoning on this was weak.  I didn’t have any Chinese cooking wine, so I sub’d dry sherry which worked out fine.  I ended up doubling the soy sauce and sherry, and added  some sliced bell pepper for a pop of color.  Turned out pretty well, served with grilled, marinated flank steak..

Yum! I made half of a medium sized cabbage and used sherry instead of the Chinese cooking wine. Super quick and easy! I don’t know why it’s taken me so long to utilize cabbage! It’s cheap and tasty. Would definitely make for Asian dishes.

Super easy and delicious! I added a little bit of Spicy Olive Cayenne Oil for a kick!

Made this tonight and my family loved it. My kids asked for more! Yumm will be making this cabbage again!

Simple, tasty and quick.  I did not have the Chinese wine, but dry sherry worked very well.  Thank you!!

The recipe I thought was just okay-not much flavor.  It was worth making one time.  Thank you for the recipe!! :)

The Stir fried cabbage was very good and easy to make.

Really good and paired well with Asian Orange Chicken I made from this site.  I didn’t have the specified wine so I used 1/2 TBLS of rice wine vinegar and 1 TBLS of apple cider vinegar. Debated about adding some thinly sliced onions to the sauté but didn’t. I think I will next time. Super easy side dish! Thanks iken!

yes; add bacon end and pieces.
