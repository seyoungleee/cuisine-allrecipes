I grew up eating NECK BONES my mother would make it into a Purlo(cook it with rice).  My husband is from Calif and he claimed he did not like pork neck bones:)  Soooo I got some put them in the crock pot then put bbq sause on them told him is was short ribs he nearly scraped the pot.  Have never told him the truth:)

I really liked the flavor but there wasn't enough meat on the bones to make it worth the trouble. You need to be a picker of the bones to enjoy this one. I cooked mine for 6 hours and the meat still didn't fall off the bones. So I continued to cook them for 4 more hours (started it at 6:00am) and the meat was still clinging to the bones. As for what to serve it with: I made a brown gray and wide egg noodles with corn on the side. Like I said the flavor was awesome! Just too time consuming.

Great recipe. I tweaked it by adding an hour, fresh roasting herbs, and subbed an all purpose seasoning with salt included.

Did not like the taste

I cooked Them for an extra hour and that made all the difference. It is delicious and I've made it many times with turkey necks.

I cooked it as written.  My personal taste just didn’t like the taste of this meat.

I absolutely loved this recipe that I made today and just finished demolishing my plate. I cooked with all provided ingredients but added 7 cups of water and cooked from 12:30 p.m -5:00p.m. My Turkey Necks fell off the bone! Thank you sooo much for this recipe.

My 7 year old son made it. He was so very proud of himself.
It was very tasty. And he'll forever remember this recipe. Because it was his first cooking experience.

I followed the recipe exactly except I didn’t have dried thyme. We still thought it tasted fantastic!

Came out great! It was very flavorful it brought us back to childhood!

It was to watery and bland. I needed to add way more salt and other spices and it still wasn't great. Also 4 hours was not enough time. I had to add another two hours.
