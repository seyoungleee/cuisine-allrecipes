Lettuce doesnâ€™t really belong in this salad. Made a hybrid of this and the Arabic Fattoush on this site. Served with Falafel balls. Everyone liked.

This is great! I didn't use radishes due to personal taste. Love experimenting with different vinegars for the dressing.

I love fattoush, so I knew I was gonna love this. The dressing is delicious! This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
