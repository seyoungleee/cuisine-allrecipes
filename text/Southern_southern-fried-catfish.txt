I personally hate fish of any kind but my boyfriend is a huge fried catfish fan. He said it was the best fried catfish he has ever had! The trick is after you bread the fish let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes. This way you wwill not have problems with the breading falling off!

2 minutes into frying, the batter came off the catfish. Maybe an egg in the buttermilk mixture would help. (I usually use whole milk and egg)

Good recipe added some onion powder and garlic powder. Yes it is best to let it set for 5-10 minutes after you bread it.

This is SO close to my Grandmother's recipe from the 50s.  Awesome.  Be sure fish is SET before frying.  It helps ingredients to adhere to the fish.

Raw at 3 minutes. 8 to 10 minutes works better

I know everyone likes to write how they changed the recipe. I did not. It turned out great.

Delicious breading sticks great and super flavorful

Absolutely perfect. Without a doubt the best fried catfish I've ever had. Did it in a deep fryer using peanut oil. If the fish is room temperature 3 minutes is perfect.

It was very simple to make and I added additional  spices

Not too bad, recommended that you let the fish set after breading them to avoid the breading falling off when frying.

This is really good. Easy to make and fries up so nicely.  My husband goes crazy for this dish!
