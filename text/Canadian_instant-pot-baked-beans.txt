awesome... good suggestion to double the "sauciness"... I also cut sugar in half and added maple syrup

This is the best of the best!  I usually add a little extra molasses and sometimes just ham base instead of bacon or salt pork

These beans were a big hit at our last potluck.  I didn't exactly double the sauce but I did add some extra molasses and a little bit of Worcestershire.

Made this several times, my family said it was almost as good as my grandmothers!

Oh my gosh these are good.  I doubled the sauce.  Yummmmm

Doubled the sauce (except the brown sugar) like many suggested.  These beans are fantastic! We have served them to guests a few times and when we invite them over for dinner again, they always ask if I'll be making beans.  They love them!

Great recipe! For a double batch (2lbs Northern beans) I used what i had on hand ~ 1lb low sodium bacon, no salt pork, dijon mustard. Plus added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and a few shakes of garlic salt. Was super delicious. Will be my goto recipe.

It was a wonderful recipe. Family LOVED it. Makes a ton, so freezing some for later is definitely a bonus

I used a full 9 oz of ham instead of salt pork to make it a bit meatier. I did end up using a 50/50 mix of navy beans and small red beans for added color and a more subtle flavor blend.  It is just a bit sweeter than I would like but is excellent just as is.

Making for second time today. It was a great hit with everyone!  I am also increasing sauce for more creaminess. The flavor is wonderful. Thanks so much for sharing.
