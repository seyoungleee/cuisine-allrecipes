Very easy and will make this again. Made exactly as written but with a bit more sour cream, a few more slices of fresh mushrooms and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce. The white wine used should be a dry wine such as Sauvignon Blanc.

I used regular mustard and mushrooms soup with roasted garlic  and it was delicious.  Quick, easy and delicious.

This is a very easy and tasty recipe. I add a bit more pepper as well as paprika to keep it from being bland.  I love casseroles as they provide me lunch for the week!

This was excellent. Made it as per the recipe and we loved it, and more importantly, our toddler grandchildren loved it.

I really liked this recipe. However, the pasta sucked up too much of the sauce and it was a little dry. I think I actually used 1 1/4 lb of ground beef as I cut in half a 2.25 lb package of beef that I had bought.  Next time I would add 1 cup of dry white wine and an extra half can of mushroom soup so that there is enough sauce.  Other than that, the recipe is easy and it is delicious!

Very Good, I would probably add a little more salt and a bit more sour cream. Easy to follow and great for leftovers.

A bit more complicated than the 60â€™s version... but worth the extras.

I give 3 stars for ease.  It went together in minutes.  I thought the end result was a bit bland.  I wanted to add a vegetable, maybe tomatoes (although that would negate the stroganoff).  Not enough complexity for me.

Great basic recipe - after reading other reviews - I didn't add the mustard, used 1 cup sherry, 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup half and half, the soup, lots of garlic salt and some parsley.....came out perfect!  Use wagon wheel pasta and sprinkled a tiny bit of shredded mozzarella before baking.  Very yummy!

This was a very good casserole. Easy to make.
