Excellent cookies. Not alot of ingredients, but it still takes awhile to prepare. I used a pasty cutter and cut out small squares instead of circles, they were much easier to overlap over the cookie. Also, I used Solo pie and pasty filling instead of the jam.

thought it was unedible, even my dogs would not eat them

Made with strawberry jam  first time if I had to grade my self C-  I like the recipe and I will keep trying until I'm satisfiedüòÅ

Horrible! The dough is gooey and does not work. Not sure if recipe is complete, but I had to start again with a better recipe.

very delicious

Marvelous little cookie! Definitely in my top 5 favorite cookies. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Don't be tempted to add more than 1/4 tsp of jam or you'll have a sticky mess. I learned this the hard way...

I doubled the cream cheese and made them into thumbprint cookies. Pastry is VERY bland; I threw out most of the cookies. A waste of time and ingredients!

As written they would be very bland, my grandmother always added pouches of Dr Oetker Vanilla Sugar to her recipe. I doubled the recipe, added 1/4 tsp salt since I used unsalted butter and added 1/2 cup homemade vanilla sugar. I used a 2 inch square cutter, I turned to a diamond shape to make it easier to get the flaps to stay together, I also dampened the top flap to stay together better. Mine baked at 350 for 16 minutes, made 107 cookies, I used homemade seedless raspberry jam to fill.

Made a roll instead of individual cookies. Worked fine.

I followed the recipe but took advice of another reviewer to make dough night before to chill before rolling out. Made a double batch of dough and did half with strawberry preserves and half with cherry preserves. I did not have a two inch cutter so used a three inch circle cutter. Cookies were a bit bigger but cooked well and were delicious.

Yummmmmmmm
