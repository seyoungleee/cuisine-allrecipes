These were yummy, sweet corn bread pancakes. We served with chicken wings which seems like a strange choice, but was pretty good. Used just half of the recipe, but followed exactly...oh but halved the amount of sugar.

These did not come out like pancakes. They were as thin or thinner than a crepes. So I took the remaining batter), added 1/2 tsp baking powder and poured them into greased ramekins.  I had enough batter for 2 ramekins and I baked them at 350 degrees for 18 minutes. They were a lot better than the pancake.

Good substitute for corn bread.  Made it to go with chili.  I thought it would be lighter, these things are dense and flavorful.  I read the reviews before and knew to decrease the sugar.  I used 1/2 cup... made it taste like cornbread-like sweetness.  I guess if you want it like candy, then sugar away my friends!!!!

these are great! I use only 1/2 cup of sugar as per other recommendations. they work great as a bun or bread pieces for pulled pork!

This is way too sweet for me, a 1/2 cup of sugar is all it needs. A decent recipe though.

This is so goooood!!! I halved the recipe and substituted cows milk with plain almond milk, still delicious! It was thinner than I thought it should be but I was using a 6 in skillet so it worked out perfect!!
