The secret to a crispy tempura batter is the shock between the hot oil and the cold batter, so I chill all ingredients, including the flour.

Nice!

Great recipe!Tempura sweet potatoes are my FAVORITE!!! So glad to have a recipe to make at home!I used  3/4cu tapioca flour with 3tbps ap flour. I also only had 1 cu vegetable oil so I fried them in smaller batches. I also double fried the potatoes and they came out fantastic! I didn’t have a wire rack so once they cooled they got a little softer and less crunchy, butthey  we’re perfect when they were still hot!10/10 will definitely be making again.

Only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the list of ingredients says 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour, and the instructions say 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon. I used the latter and it worked out great!

Just as good as the ones I had at Edo . The dipping sauce was yummy as well
