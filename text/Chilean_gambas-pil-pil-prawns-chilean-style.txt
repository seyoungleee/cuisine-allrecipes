I cannot say enough about this recipe.  The recipe calls for a lot of garlic, but when beautifully browned, it is just enough.  The shrimp come out juicy, and full of delicious flavor!  This recipe is WONDERFUL, just as it is!

Looks good

Great!

it was good but there wasn't much favour to it other than the brandy.
