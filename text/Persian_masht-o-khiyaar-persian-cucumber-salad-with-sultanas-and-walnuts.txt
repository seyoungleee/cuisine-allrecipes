Delicious. I used regular raisins instead of sultanas and the result was still good.

I reduced the yoghurt to 1 cup, which I think was still too much. The yoghurt overpowered all the other ingredients. With the leftover salad, I added some rice wine vinegar and additional sliced cucumbers, which made it more balanced. I will make again using even less yoghurt, thinned with vinegar for a lighter dressing.

Really good! I liked the combination of the sultanas with the crunch of walnuts. I substituted greek yogurt instead of straining regular yogurt, but still turned out very well.
