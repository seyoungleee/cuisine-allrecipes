Thank you, I always cook pig tails. Only after the boiling point, let cool and remove all bones. I add a package of baby lima's, a large chopped onion,one tsp. garlic and black pepper. Cornbread goes great. I usually freeze a couple containers and serve as a side for another day.

I wasn't sure what to do with the garlic so I boiled it along with the pig tails. The pig tails came out exactly the way they did in picture, however the meat had no taste. I am not sure how to improve the taste.

Excellent

Garlic salt instead of garlic cloves, added ranch seasoning. N mustard

Excellent

Pig tails.  Delicious!!! Who knew?????  This was my first time eating pig tails.  I cooked them for 45 minutes in a pressure cooker, drained them well and finished them up in my new air fryer oven for about 25 minutes ( some took a little longer to crisp up, so I removed the smaller ones and gave the others another 10 minutes in the air fryer). I made a dressing of soy sauce, white cooking wine, and balsamic vinegar and added just a little no calorie sweetener.    I am hooked.  Now Iâ€™m wondering at my ripe old age of 75, what else have I been missing?

No changes! Just like my Bigma used to make! Deelicious!

Sorry they didn't make it  to the oven.  I tried them and before I knew it, they were gone!

My pig tails came out perfect!!!

For me it needed more seasoning.
