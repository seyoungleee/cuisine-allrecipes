This was amazing! Like an upscale bread pudding, only a bit lighter. Made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it! There wasn’t any left! Will make it again!

For a phyllo cake, i thought it would have been light and flaky. With the yougart egg mixture it was quite heavy. It tasted ok, just wasnt what my expectations had hoped for.

Everyone loved this cake.  I followed others suggestions by drying out the filo in the oven at 200 degrees.  I also needed more time in the oven to get the color right.  Huge success!  I even gave it to Greek friends who loved it.

Excellent! I’ve made it twice… nailed it the 2nd time.It is essential to dry the phyllo out thoroughly and then crumble very small. To speed it up,  I bunched mine up into 2 trays and put it in the oven at 200 degrees and checked it every 10 minutes. Took pieces out and crumbled them as they dried. Used regular olive oil as directed (EVOO was too strong) and mine was done in 40 minutes in a glass pan.From another Greek, thank you for the easy to follow recipe! Yia sou.

I haven’t tried it yet but will be eating it tonight.  The consistency is definitely not a cake, but more of a dense bread pudding, and very heavy.

This is awesome!!!  It is like a bread pudding but super good.  We put a little more a little more cinnamon in, but that's because  we like extra cinnamon. First rate!

Might cook it a little less next time but it was fabulous!
