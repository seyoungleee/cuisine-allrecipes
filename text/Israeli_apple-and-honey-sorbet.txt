Excellent! I made the recipe as written and it turned out just great. The apple froze solid overnight in my freezer, so when I put all the stuff in my food processor and processed it, it was almost ready to serve with very little additional freezing. I agree that the peel does add texture (as indicated in the recipe), but in this case, that is not a bad thing. I will be making this one often!

I have been using this recipe for a few years now and it's a family favorite. Absolutely delicious. I don't have an ice cream machine so I froze the pureed mixture and when frozen put it thru a food processor and refroze it. Works great.

Will definetly make again!

This turned out super creamy and super delicious! I would use about half the sugar next time, but I'm sure it depends on how sweet the apples are to start with.

YUM!

This was a fun recipe to make!  I tripled the recipe as I was making it to bring in to my daughter's class.  I did peel about 1/2 of the apples.  The flavor & texture were excellent.  I was worried because I tasted it before I churned it & the lemon was very strong - but when I served it the next day, the lemon was not overpowering, it just enhanced the apple flavor.

Delicious!

I can say that this is good .But i use this recipe for Applesauce and add Truvia .It is real sweetner that has no caloric count and if your a Diabetic then Its better for you than sugar or Honey.If you add cinnamon to this its great also.4 starsi rate it.

This was frozen sweetened applesauce!  It tastes good; next time, I might add some cinnamon and nutmeg!

A good sorbet, but definitely too sweet for my taste if made as directed.  It tasted a bit like frozen applesauce.  I used a blender, and it came out a little grainy/mealy; next time I'll try the food processor.

I made this for rosh hashanah dinner and everyone LOVED this!  Awesome recipe, thanks for sharing it!  I will continue to make this for new years dinner.
