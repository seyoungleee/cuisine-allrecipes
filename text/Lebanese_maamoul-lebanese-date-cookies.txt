I was looking for a perfect recipe of these cookies, and finally I found it. The texture of the dough was very easy to work with, and the final result was amazing!I used coconut oil instead of butter, and cardamom instead of mahlab.

very simple recipe.  Out of preference, I added more orange blossom water as well as some rosewater to the dough, added more Mahalba as well.   I also added toasted sesame seeds, cinnamon and nutmeg to the date paste.  I used the dough to make two versions of the cookie.  In the second version, I toasted chopped walnuts adding some orange blossom water and sugar.  Both were equally good.  The trick is to let the dough settle overnight before going on to the next step so the semolina can absorb the butter.  thanks so much!

Thank you for this amazing recipe! My husband is from Jordan, and his exact words were, “Ooo very authentic tasting!” :) love these cookies and will make many times!
