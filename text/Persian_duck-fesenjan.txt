I prepped mine on the stove and then transferred to a slow cooker to simmer away while I was at work. So delicious and so easy. Chef John wins again!

Used chicken instead of duck . Everyone raved about it . Will make again !

Loved it, fabulous flavors. Wouldn't change a thing. Will make again.

I had to modify the recipe since only had ground duck and no yellow onion or pomegranate, but it turned out Amazing! I made a berry molasses in place of pomegranate and used red and green onions, placed over a bed of rosemary sage Freekeh. TaDah!

I usually cook ground walnuts alone for at least 2 hours to extract all the oil of walnuts so I don't add any extra oil to the stew. Chef john, thanks and here are my suggestions for Persian dessert: Faloodeh and Ghotab

A festive dish worth the effort.
