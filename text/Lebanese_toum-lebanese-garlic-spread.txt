This is the only recipe for toum that I use, and it turns out perfectly every time. I buy the pre-peeled garlic now to make it easier. Just make sure to drizzle that oil in slowly while the food processor is on and be patient. Your patience will be rewarded with the most amazing toum that is the perfect accompaniment for your chicken tawook kabobs! It’s also amazing on fresh, warm pita bread.I measure a cup of garlic cloves, since sizes can vary, and use canola oil because it’s on hand. I’ve been told the toum will last 3-4 months in the fridge, as it does make a ton. I’ve never had it last that long (sometimes I give some away, sometimes we eat it all ourselves), so I cannot confirm.Make it and enjoy!
