I do not know anyone who eats them for breakfast, and I live in Denmark, Scandinavia.  In the old days we came, a small piece of apple in the middle of the cake. Now uses many prunes.  Just for fun, here is the letter "Æ" in Æbleskiver.  Æble = apple

if you eat them without jam, jelly, or some type of syrup to sweeten them, they are bland & boring.  Maybe I will try to use the pan with a better pancake recipe. The dogs enjoyed them greatly.

No changes! Been looking for an aebleskiver recipe since I lost mine. This what I was looking for. Very good!

I've used a variety of Aebble Skivver recipes over the years...can't say that any of them was better than this...

...these are a family favorite...now a traditional send-off meal...

We make them for breakfast...which today was a little after noon...they are so good that you can/should eat them any time....

I have made this recipe a couple of times for my in-laws who are Danish.  They all LOVED it.  That's a huge compliment because they are all very particular about traditional Danish foods.  I followed the recipe as it.

A bit of cardamon and less salt

I use the common milk and lemon substitute for buttermilk (1cup milk 2 tbp lemon juice) and bake them in muffin tins (15 min at 375) since I don't have the pan. This works great! Wonderful recipe.

Delicious! I was super nervous making these for the first time, but they were way easier than I thought they would be! Perfect recipe! I didn’t have any buttermilk, so I used 2 cups of milk with 1 tablespoon +1 teaspoon lemon juice and let it sit for two minutes before adding it. My kids ate 4 batches of these before I took them away! Ha ha!

This was a great recipe. Love the "soft peaks" instructions on the egg whites. These were great. The only thing that I did differently, is that I added 1/4 cup of water to the batter, because it was very foamy, and the batter wouldn't fill-out, as I rotated these in their little round divots in the pan.

Use butter in the divots, and cook them on med-low. I let the pan warm up while I was making the batter. Also, you need to make sure that your cast iron pan is good and seasoned beforehand.

Really happy to have found this recipe.

UPDATE: I made these again, and forgot about my adding 1/4 cup of water comment. These were FABULOUS!
Everything else was the same. And, I use Buttermilk Powder and sift it in with the dry ingredients, because I don't usually have real buttermilk on-hand.
We got a total of 32 Aebleskivers out of this recipe.

This is almost exactly the same recipe my mother makes for our special breakfast every Christmas season!  Love it!  Glad to see other people enjoying Æbleskiver as well.
