everyone loved it.  if you want to make your own ghee:
1.  melt unsalted butter in stainless steel pot at very low heat.  2. once melted, slightly increase heat.  3.  decrease slightly if it starts to smoke or show signs of scorching.  do not let it burn.  4.  remain at this point for about an hour, checking often but not disturbing.  5.  after an hour let cool for about 15 minutes.  6. carefully skim foam and floating substances from top with spoon. 7.  filter remaining clear liquid into clean jar.  use cheesecloth,
coffee filter, or paper towel. 8.  cover and store in a cool place.

I find this recipe rather strange.In England,a Chicken Jalfrezi is a firey dish made with green and red peppers and  plenty of chillies/chilli powder.Maybe us English have just butchered the original recipe,(Indians living in Britain have created new curry dishes to suit our palates that are unheard of back in India),but i advise you to add bell-peppers to this recipe as its not only more health,but adds fantastic flavour to the dish.

This a very tasty recipe and easy to make. I used all of the ingredients that the recipe calls for. I served it with a salad and inside a pocket tortilla.

We love this! I double this recipe and even add a fourth pound of  thighs because it is even more delicious as leftovers. We serve it over basmati rice with creamy, dilly  cucumber salad on the side. Wonderful!

I cook this in batches,  we love it!

easy to make; delicious to eat.

Made recipe as directed, and it was delicious!  Definitely will make again.  I will reduce the turmeric slightly, as I agree it was a bit much.  Thank you for this recipe!

excellent!!

didn't change a thing, so much flavor and very easy to make

Good recipe - although I doubled the spices and added yogurt at the end.

This recipe is amazing!

Absolutely delicious just the way it is!!!! Yummmmmm - this will be made many times in my future!
