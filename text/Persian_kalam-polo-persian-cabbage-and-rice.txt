I liked the flavors here but agree with some of the things other reviewers said - less cinnamon, more turmeric, lots of salt and pepper. I also felt like you could do less beef and more cabbage, the cabbage disappears by the end. The other trouble I had was in the directions, they're a little overly complicated and at the end it took a long time and a lot of extra water to get the rice tender for me.

Good recipe except for the amount of cinnamon and there is no ginger in Persian cooking.  I grew up eating and making this rice.  Another alternative is adding some tomato juice instead of water and have the base with tomatoes.

This was pretty good, and I honestly think it made way more than 4 servings. I'd increase the salt & pepper, otherwise it ends up tasting like cinnamon oatmeal. We ate this with Shirazi salad as suggested, and my husband really liked mixing the rice with some of the dressing from the salad.Also the recipe only uses 1/4 of the saffron brew it makes, so I would decrease the amount made, or else have a plan for how to use the rest. I could only find saffron threads, so I used the whole container (0.01 oz Badia Saffron Pure Selected)

Delicious - even won over the skeptics in my home! I didn't have saffron, used turmeric in its place.

Directions a little confusing. Seasoning was too mild. Recommend using fresh ginger and more cinnamon. Might benefit from a few extra veggies mixed in.

This looks great! Definitely gonna make this tonight. Thank you!
