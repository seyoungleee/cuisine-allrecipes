This creme brulee was super fast and  easy and turned out to be so good, without double broiling or straining..!
It made 4 servings for me because I used the shallow, 3 oz, creme brulee ramekins and it took only 30 minutes for the creme to set. 
I added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to the 2 tablespoons of white sugar for better "bruling ".
Also, my torch was out of butane, so I broiled  the chilled creme, 6 inches away from the heat source, for 3 minutes  and then put back in the fridge for 15 minutes to harden the sugar crust.

Gets all the praise from my family so it’s definitely good enough for yours.

Simple yet delicious!

Great recipe. I don’t have a torch so I used a broiler for the caramelization at the end, which worked well!

Ive never made this type of thing before, but it was super easy and delicious. My family went crazy for it.

Love this recipe, so simple to follow!

It was great! Ridiculously easy and ridiculously good. Highly recommended!

Superb! Absolutely delicious and super easy! I followed the directions, the only thing I did different was I used homemade vanilla extract and on step 2 I saved 1 cup of the cream before microwaving to mix in with the yolks that way they would be easier to temper with the hot cream mixture.

This surprised me at how easy and delicious it was. I already had all of the ingredients on hand and loved making something I had never made before. Perfect consistency.

Excellent and easy. I added a dash of cinnamon to the top for contrast, but outside of that I wouldn’t change a thing! 
I do need to buy a torch though. I used the broiler and kept a eye on them, turned out fine.
YUMMY!
