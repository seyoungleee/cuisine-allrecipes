This recipe is almost failproof. You'll get a nice moist buttery boterkoek that is absolutely not sandy!

Just what I was looking for, not too sweet, not too complicated, but so delicious! I added cinnamon to the dough and topped it with a circle of whole almonds on top. Perfect! Thank you!

The house likes it eat ice cream or drink milkshake with it.

I like the subtle lemon flavor.
