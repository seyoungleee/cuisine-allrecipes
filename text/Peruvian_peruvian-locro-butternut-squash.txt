Asome dish.  didnt have the condensed milk used cream of mushroom soup as substitute, and used canned veggies corn carrots and greenbeans.  great dish My teens loved it.

Simple and easy recipe, but it would be a lot better with a few spices.  I added chili powder and ground cumin after my first bowl.

In view of the fact several reviewers thought it was bland, I added red pepper flakes, hot pickled peppers, olives, cumin and turmeric. I used plain milk instead of evaporated.

Definitely filling. Yum.

oh we will be making it again had it on rice first night we did add some ham diced up and peas

I really recommend to use banana squash since butternut squash is too sweet for this recipe.  I am Peruvian and love this dish just not with sweet squash

My husband and I thought the recipe as it's written is pretty bland. We might try it again with additional spices like cumin and chili powder. It also made a TON. We had leftovers for daysssss.

This was so delicious!  When I tasted from the pot it was perfect; when tasted over rice it became bland. I just put steak seasoning into the rice this time and it was better... I checked out Peruvian spices and will add them to the rice next time. The Peruvian Locro was definitely  5 stars!!!

I followed the recipe as written, but none of us liked it at all.

Easy to make, yummy to eat.  We liked it best with salt & pepper, so maybe next time, we'll put more salt in at the salt-to-taste part.
