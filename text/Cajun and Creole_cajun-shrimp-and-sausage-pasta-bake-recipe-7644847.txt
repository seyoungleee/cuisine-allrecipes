Although the  instructions don't include the spreadable cheese , I assumed that it went in before the Parmesan cheese to complete the sauce . Please complete the instructions! I literally just made it and before I could get a photo my family dove into it !!! I did however add a photo that shows what it looks like before I put the cheeses sauce on top. As you can see I added a little bit of lump crab meat. And oh my god what an outstanding dish! I also used Slap yo mama Cajun seasoning because that’s the only kind we use . It was tasty. This is definitely a keeper for the family rotation!
