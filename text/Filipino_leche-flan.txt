I followed the recipe exactly, placed the pan in a water bath covered in tin foil at 325Â° for an hour. I pulled it out and let it sit for 30. Problem is the flan was still 3/4 liquid! Barely any of it cooked enough to solidify it and before you ask no I am not at a high elevation no now I'm going to put it in for another 15 min and then check it again.

this leche flan recipe is slightly different than the ones we bought from the Philippines. much tastier, the sweetness is just right and my kids loved it. kudos to you!
