5 for flavor!Total crepe novice so there was a bit of learner's curve. (I know these are called Swedish pancakes.)For the crépe batter, I used oat flour bc wanted it gf. Other than that, followed directions to a t.Refrigerated batter overnight.Definitely need 4+ minutes on the 1st side & 1+min on 2nd.I didn't make the filling, but now have confidence to play around with it with df substitutes.I did not add water to the blueberries bc of the other review & will add next time to make it more of a syrup. Was super sweet, so might want less sugar.Overall, it was a warm landing for a 1st time crépe maker!Looking forward to playing with this more and then trying blintzes with this crépe as the base!

This takes a little bit of planning and effort but the results are delicious.  I would use less water next time in the blueberry mixture.  I initially tried to use my crepe maker but it didn't work out well, so in the pan it went.
