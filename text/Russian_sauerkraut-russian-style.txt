This was my first time at homemade sauerkraut, and loved how it turned out. I followed the recipe pretty much as written except did not have a carrot. Also, I used my food processor to do a rough chop on the cabbage. I bought a 2 gal crock for it which worked well for one head of cabbage, a one gal. would probably work. Quick, easy, and healthy, it stayed nicely in the fridge in a large lock and lock container. I am making another batch today. Loved it.

Great recipe . Mine took a bit longer 7 days and I didn't  add sugar.Thank you!

Awesome it was great!  I kind of left it a little bigger than thin slices. I like how crunchy it came out!. And it was easy. Love sauerkraut.

Yes, this is how it's made!
