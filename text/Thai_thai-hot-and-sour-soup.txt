I have used this same recipe for two years now and it is the best.  I have not used basil or coriander with it though but I will try it next time.   Refreshing with the lemongrass and sinfully spicy.  Great recipe!

Works with the following substitutions:
1 tsp lime zest = 2 kaffir lime leaves
1 tsp lemongrass paste = 2 lemongrass stalks
shrimp instead of chicken

Made the soup, it was very tasty however quite salty so I will use low sodium broth next time. I also used shrimp instead of chicken which was great!

This "Thai Hot and Sour Soup" is really good! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Wowsers, this has got to be the best recipe I’ve ever used from AllRecipes!!!  We like a little kick in our food and this soup was supremely satisfying. Thanks for sharing!

Homerun with fish stock and assorted seafoods

I love this because it’s so quick and easy and has the authentic taste of hot and sour Thai soup.  I used shrimp and red curry paste instead of Tom Yum paste (didn’t have any).  I threw in a 1/2 tablespoon of Splenda brown sugar and Serrano chiles- awesome if you like it spicy!  I accidentally posted triplicate pics- sorry about that!

I really liked this soup. I made this to the letter, except I did not add a bunch of cilantro when I saw that this had only 3 cups of stock in it. I sprinkled a little on top and used the rest for another recipe.

Amazing.  I made it with shrimp and bunapi mushrooms and it is fast, healthy, and delicious.  I double the recipe and serve it with rice as a main course for two of us.  Absolutely delicious.

It tastes pretty close to authentic Thai soup.  It looks like not enough liquid at the beginning, but it is.  Don't add more liquid or it will be disproportionate.  One thing I would change is using a different mushroom.  Some Asian mushrooms probably will taste better.
