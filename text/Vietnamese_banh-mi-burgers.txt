I'm the submitter of the recipe.  Pleaese note that the rice vinegar is unseasoned.  If you are using seasoned rice vinegar, please omit the sugar.  The burgers can be cooked to your preference as long as you keep to the recommended safe temp.  We prefer them browned.

Loved the burgers (used ground chicken instead of pork).  I can see making into small meatballs and adding to a beautiful Vietnamese noodle soup.  Definitely a keeper!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I will add a bit of jalepeno to the pickle mixture.  It was good but seemed to be missing a layer.

Delicious! Lots of flavor

Delicious! My Japanese DIL said they tasted exactly like the ones served in a popular Tokyo restsurant. I was overly cautious about the spiciness, so only added half the amount of chili paste called for. Next time, I'll use 3/4 the directed amount. I doubled the veggies and their marinade. I will triple those next time. I made 8 parties and served them with a choice of toasted whole wheat hard rolls, and lettuce wraps.

Made this with 1 lb of ground pork. Added the entire amount of seasonings to the meat and also increased the cucumber salad (added a finely minced Thai pepper to the cucumbers) It was delicious!  But we didnâ€™t make the sandwich. Served it with white rice and used the cucumber salad plus dressing over the rice. Will definitely make this again.

The whole family loves these!! Delicious!!

I really enjoyed this burger.  I followed other reviews and used 1 lb. ground pork, but kept the sauce measurements the same.  The burgers were very wet and kind of fell apart, but turned out moist and delicious.  I would make again.

Man, this is so good!  My picky, picky husband approves!!!

Loved it! Would probably add ~1/2 a jalapeno to the pickle mixture next time.
