i have to start with a huge complaint.   Maybe its just my ignorance...but i dispise recipes that lioe this one call for green chiles.  like jalapenos are the same as pablonos or Anaheims.  the first time iwent with Anaheim's.   this time i added jalapenos and pablanos.  both times i added. cardamom and doubled garlic and ginger.   love the dish.

My dear friend, sorry to break the news but this recipe is decades old. Secondly you need to fry all the spices first and then add the chicken and garnish. Third it's a Pakistani recipe and not Indian.

Very delicious and informative ☺️

Dry coriander powder and sliced ginger are also added mostly in Paksiatni Karhai recipe. 
I think ginger on top is like a must.

I make sure that I cook out all of the  water and have a gravy like consistency as my Pakistani friends have taught me. I even added some ground coriander as one friend recommends. Once you get it gravy like, the seasoning really comes out and gives the chicken so much flavor. I have made this many times!!!
