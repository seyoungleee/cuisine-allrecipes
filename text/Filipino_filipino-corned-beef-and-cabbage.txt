This dish was easy to make and very good!

I loved this, easy to put together, and very tasty.I did not serve over rice,better for me without the rice, (diabetes)

I prefer using organic cold pressed unfiltered coconut oil to saut√© onions and tomatoes before adding the cabbage. I also add more cabbage and I use a whole white onion and more tomatoes to give the dish some of a sauce. As the corned beef is already salted, I don't any any more salt.

So good! Thank you!

This is very good and very easy.  It is better with some added salt and some sriracha.

This was fast and easy, my husband insisted  we try it this year. We enjoyed it. I doubled the recipe for a big group. His mother came over she is a Filipina and says it should be served over rice.

Delicious! It's a nice change from my usual way of making corned beef with just onions and garlic.

My original recipe actually said to put this over rice, as Filipinos usually do. But apparently the rice got lost in translation. Hahaha. Please do enjoy this recipe over rice. And thanks for the great rates!
