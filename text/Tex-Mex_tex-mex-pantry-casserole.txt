absolutely DELICIOUS!!! didn’t change a thing- it’s PERFECT. Will def make again.

I added cilantro and guacamole as toppings and it was very good, will make again

This dish was very good!  Very flavorful!  Just what I was looking for!  The only changes I made is I doubled the recipe and I added extra cheese!  Great reheated for leftovers!  Will definitely be making again!

Doubled it and made it as written except used diced tomatoes & pinto beans for sauce & black beans (pantry supply).  Tasted great,  rice was done.  Served with our favorite hint of lime tortilla chips.
