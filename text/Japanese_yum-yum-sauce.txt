I found a recipe by a chef who bought the sauce, read the label for ingredients, and kept making it until he got it right. He said that the type of mayo used will affect how it tastes...I haven't had a chance to make it yet but the website is justtherecipe.com

I'm confused because I have been cooking for a long time... sure do know how to follow a recipe and I followed this to the letter. I know yum yum sauce and this wasn't it.  Not sure why this is rating so well.  Sorry.  :(

I ordered Hibachi takeout, but they forgot to include Yum Yum sauce.  I quickly mixed this up, but used Heinz Chili Sauce instead of tomato paste.  It was delicious!

3 stars for this recipe as printed, 5 stars for my modified version = 4 star average. ðŸ˜‰ I use ketchup and eliminate sugar, rice vinegar (1 TBL) instead of whatâ€™re, sriracha instead of cayenne. When I serve with shrimp I substitute horseradish (and up the amount)

Our local Chinese restaurant said that they make theirs using ketchup. I made this recipe as written...  Nope, not right. So I added ketchup. Now were getting somewhere! I added a little ore each time until it was perfect. So that's the key. Use ketchup. I also doubled the sugar.

It's perfect, so great for a dipping sauce with fondue, tasty for shrimp, scallops, chicken and beef.

Yummy with chicken

it was good but alot of tweeking.

Made it as recipe was written. Was delicious with our pork fried rice.  Iâ€™ll add extra cayenne next time.  Just because we like a little more spice

This was perfect! Will definitely make this again. :)

It really doesnâ€™t taste anything like what you get at the Japanese restaurants. I wish it did so I could give a higher score but it does
