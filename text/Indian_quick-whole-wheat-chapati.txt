I love the chapati. It has a nice flavor without the added lard or shortening.  I did have to tweak the recipe. Only use 1/2 cup of water and then add water as needed. If you add a whole cup of water you will have a very sticky dough. Also, make sure your water is warm water. After making 8 small balls, let the dough rest for ten minutes before cooking.  Meanwhile turn the heat to medium high on a cast iron griddle. Cook the chapati until you see bubbles start to form and then flip, about 10 seconds per side. Then flip for another ten seconds. Flip over again for another 10 seconds to make sure chapita is cooked.

Nice..

I followed others suggestions to use warm water & add as needed for the dough. I also let the dough rest for ~10 min in the refrigerator, before shaping & rolling out. Added fresh garlic and used olive oil on the griddle. Came out perfect!

Turned out great!

The chapatis were so soft as I used Aashirvaad Select Atta.

Maybe I overworked the dough or something but these were too hard to chew if not eaten right away.

Love this recipe!  I don't buy wraps anymore.  I just added a touch of chia seeds and flax for an extra nutritional boost.  I agree with Lela, I'll add less water next time because the dough was sticky with one cup.

This is perhaps one of the simplest bread recipes ever.  I spread my first batch with beans and avocado for a quick meal.  Next, I will add different types of vegetables. The sky is the limit.  It perfectly fits my new mediterranean way of eating.  Will definitely be a keeper for me!  Thanks for sharing.

Fabulous and easy to make too!  A definite keeper.

I followed other people's advice to pour in the water a little bit at a time and it worked out well. I ended up needing about 1/4 cup more but it turned out great. Super easy and doesn't detract from the taste of the filling.

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!
