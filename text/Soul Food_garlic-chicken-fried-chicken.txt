I am Southern and I can fry some chicken, but this impressed me. I usually fry with just flour, salt and pepper, but I added the spices and the egg mixture. It was good. I didn't measure anything out, just threw the spices in. I added alot more garlic, I love it, and of course more salt amd pepper. I salted and peppered the chicken and the egg mixture. You cannot fry chicken in 15 minutes. I cooked on high for 5, then flipping, on medium, with lid on for 20. Nice and crispy. Served with baked potato and corn. Will make again.

This was just okay, not as good as I thought it would be.  I did read the submitter's review and use Tablespoons not teaspoons of garlic powder and I'm glad I did or it would have been incredibly plain.

I didn't have a thermometer to check the oil temp; it took less than 5 mins each side for me. I loved how quick and easy it was to prepare and it tasted great

Loved it! I added more garlic and salt as suggested by other reviewers. Also I ran out of breadcrumbs so I used crushed Ritz crackers instead. Great recipe!

It was good & my husband loved it....I did add more garlic powder like the others & a bit more salt.

My family liked it simple and good

I don’t cook. I made this. Followed the recipe exactly, except I didn’t pound out the chicken and used six breasts. My family loved it!!! Will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing!!!

I did add a little more garlic and cut back on the pepper ( I can't eat much pepper) but otherwise did the recipe as is. Was great! You really need to try this recipe. Tasted absolutely delicious!!

My family loves this recipe..I add a lot more garlic and add cayenne pepper.

we really  liked it   ,we eat  more  Chicken  than beef  steak  so really  appreciated this recipe    we will  make it again  for sure  ,My husband really  liked it

It was fast and easy to make and it tasted WONDERFUL. We didn't have any eggs so we used a 1/2 cup of sour cream and it still tasted great.
