We call this Ham Jam in our house because it is awesome as a ham glaze or condiment. If you can catch them in stores (or if you have a tree), Damson plums are especially good for ham glaze.  I don’t have a tree and it seems like they are only ever in our market for a couple days.  Anyway, this is great!

It should say sterilize  jars 15 minutes. Five minutes isn’t long enough to sterilize jars.I made it mostly in the Instapot, adding the sugar in the first step, boiling off the water after it was slow cook for 4 hours, on top of the stove for 2 hours.It tastes good, but the the temperature it should be to reach the jarring step I am finding that it seems to be 210 F  (about 100 C) which is just below thread level, because higher than that it would be gummy and then hard candy, anyway it burns before reaching candy level.Tastes good, though.
