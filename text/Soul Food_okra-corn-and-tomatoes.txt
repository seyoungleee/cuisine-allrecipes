I didn't have file powder and I really don't know what it is or where to buy it. However, the food still turned out good by replacing it with 2 bouillion cubes of beef or chicken. Yummmmm.

I didn't try this recipe as I've been making it for years with shrimp and sausage. Try it with stewed tomatoes. File powder is ground sassafras and can be found in Texas and Louisiana in the spice section. It's a base for gumbo.

Very, very good. I also did not have file on hand, but used Cajun seasoning. Also used fresh corn. I will make this all summer long!

Was a top notch dish. Left out the bacon to make it vegan. Was scrumptuous.

I’ve made this a dozen times. I used turkey bacon. And I still don’t know what file powder is. But it’s excellent every time!

I fry 4 slices of bacon until crispy, then remove from the pan. Fry the onion in the bacon fat until it starts to soften, then add okra(I use fresh). Then add the corn (fresh again). Finish with the file powder, 1 tbsp. Worcestershire, and Louisiana hot sauce to taste . Add the tomatoes and simmer. Sprinkle with the crumbled bacon and serve. A family favorite !

My mom always make this. It was one of my favorite meals.  You dont have to use file. Thats what people use to make gumbo. Its usually in the seasoning section.

I made changes to the recipe.  I used fresh okra and corn from the ear of boiled corn; and fresh tomatoes. I also didn't use bacon grease , but I used olive oil.

Made this using cumin instead of file powder. Everyone loved it.

So easy.  I added some more spices to spice it up.

Leave out the bacon - really does not need pig grease to be good. I used all fresh veggies, real tomatoes (not canned), corn cut off the cob, and fresh okra.  Add red pepper flakes and a can of tomato sauce. No added salt either- there’s plenty in the canned sauce.  Now *that’s* a healthy recipe.
