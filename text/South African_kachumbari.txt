I know I will love this salad and making the leftovers into gazpacho soup which is one of my favorites in the summer time.Thank you... : )

This is a refreshing, beautiful salad to present! No changes were necessary for my taste. Simply delicious!

I made this last week and it was so good! The only change I made was leaving out the cilantro because I don't like it. But this was so fresh and delicious! 5*s
