I am Brazilian and had done it so many times. But a bit different . No add water. I put two sheets of aluminum foil on the counter and spice the rib there. wraps up and seal well. Take to roast , turning every hour. Them take off  the aluminum foil and let it turn brown. Easy and delicious.

The ribs were tender but kind of flat with just salt as a seasoning. We did enjoy them but won’t Manley them again.

Do NOT wrap these in foil. I know, 6 hours in the oven should produce shoe leather. The fat rendered out for the most part, leaving tender flavorful beef under a wonderful mahogany bark. I used a mister to spritz when called for and coarse sea salt that melted right in. if these were tough, make sure you used the right cut.

First time cooking beef ribs and I wanted to keep it simple. It doesn't  get any easier than this.  Easy to follow recipe, simple ingredients and best of all delicious.

Very tender and delicious.....slow cooking is the only way to cook ribs.

tough chewy the worst

These turned out excellently. This was the first time I’ve ever made these. So pleased I tried. I have a convection oven and it only too 5 hrs. So tender and flavorful. Will definitely make them again ??

I used short ribs. Seasoned them with steak seasoning consisting of coarse salt, spices,red and black peppers. Added a little kosher salt. No water. Covered tightly in foil. Put in 275 degree oven for 3hrs. The taste was incredible. I made gravy with the  essence. Served over rice. My family loved it. Next time will use beef ribs.

These are superb!  They are just as good as the beef ribs at Texas de Brazil.  Mouthwatering.

Love this recipe! It turns out really well if followed as written. And you can always add additional seasoning or sauce at the end.
