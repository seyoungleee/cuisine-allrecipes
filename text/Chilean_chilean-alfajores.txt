Just reading this recipe I was a little bit suspicious of it but I figured I would try it anyway because I wanted to do the chilean take on Alfajores. Clearly this wasn’t it I’m not really sure what’s up with the ratios, but 7tbsp of flour and butter? You’re gonna want cornstarch if you want it to be like a shortbread cookie there was no specifications on whether or not you should refrigerate the Dell, so I just did everything as specified in the recipe, no matter what my personal opinion was. As I expected, the cookies totally melted and flattened out. The dough was really soft and not really workable.
