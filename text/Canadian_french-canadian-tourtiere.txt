Use all pork for truly authetic French Canadian flavor. You can fix the filling one day and serve the tourtiere the next day.  Letting the filling sit over night really lets the spices flavor the filling.  Update:  I have found that it gets better the day after.  So prepare it in advance and reheat if you have the time.

Hi, I am French Canadian and my mom always put 1/3 pork, 1/3 veal and 1/3 beef.... this has to much salt and shouldn't have to put water... my mom put a mash potatoe to reduce the liquid and to bind everything together...

I liked it

I used both beef and pork. First time I've made tourti√®re.

Reading the comments and people saying it's not traditional French canadian... just silly. My recipe is over 150 yrs old French Canadian and varies a lot. Completely different spices. Different regions will vary.Mine uses 50/50 beef and pork (1 lb each),  Boil in water with 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cloves, salt to taste. Boil and break down. Serve with Strawberry jam. I'm not fond of the turkey seasonings in this one but to each their own.

This pie was great! Super simple, filling, flavorful, and was enjoyed by all.

I ADDED 1 FENNEL BULB DICED INTO 1/4 INCH PIECES

Not French  Canadian in the least. French Canadian contains Beef,  Pork and VEAL. You may may prepacks at and grocery store at Christmas  time.

I live in Quebec all my life.

I used all ground beef and as diabetics are eating I only used crust on top and sweetened with erythrotal  came ou great

I made multiple pies.  They turned out amazingly but the next time I will cut back on the water.

made this and it was wonderful will make it again next time i will do it with the tourtire spice recipe that is here
