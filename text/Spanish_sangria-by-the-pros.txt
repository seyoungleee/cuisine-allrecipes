This recipe is amazing! I doubled the recipe, but kept the fruit in the same amount & it was the perfect ratio. I feel like if there was less liquid (as called for in the original quantity of the recipe), it would be too chunky & perhaps difficult to drink.

The flavor of this was just right! Yum!

**Also, just a little tip for anyone who hasn't thought of it: Instead of adding the soda into the pitcher, I just topped off each glass with a splash of it as I served them, so the soda wouldn't go flat throughout the evening! This worked great!**

It was alright, but Ive had better

Perfect

This tastes exactly like the Sangria from my favorite local restaurant.

This was soooo good!  I doubled it, but next time would not double the fruit. The brandy soak of fruit is a must. Didn't want to use my good red, so used Riunite Lambrusco and prosecco (or cava) instead of lemon-lime soda, so it wasn't too sweet.

This recipe makes the best sangria I have ever had.

exactly what i was looking for...wanted a more tropical feel not spanish style...i know i have a problem when im finishing off a [itcher to myself but this was so sweet and good...

Best sangria recipe ever!  I have made this many times.  Made exactly as written.   Perfection!

I loved it!! And so did my guest!!   my changes which was only fruit white nectarines are in season....added frozen grapes and blueberries.....This was delicious!!

Very good. I recommend doubling the wine, brandy and oj. Otherwise, there is a lot

I thought this was too dry. I would add some sugar, but that's my taste. If you like dry red wine, you may like it. My guests did like it but I prefer white wine sangria. I was very easy to make though.
