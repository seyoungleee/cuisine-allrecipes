Very, very good recipe.  I made a few changes, however, to spice it up and add flavor after reading some of the other reviews.  1: add 1 tsp. cumin powder to onions/garlic while cooking, 2: add one small can of diced mild chiles when you add the beans, 3: use broth (any kind) instead of water.  Also diminish the amount of liquid to 2 cups instead of 2 and a 1/2.  Hope this helps!  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

We found this recipe a bit bland and intend on spicing it up a little next time with some chilli, cracked black pepper and topping with some deep fried basil leaves, but as a base it is very good.

Agree with a number of the other reviewers. Excellent recipe as a base. Lots of room here to tweak to your personal tastes. I started with andouille sausage and then saut√©ed the peppers and onion in that fat.  Making again today!

I have been making this recipe for about 15 years now. It's in my regular meal rotation. Not easy finding good vegan recipes but this one is super! A lot of times I sub black beans for the red ones (makes no difference in taste) because black beans are easier to find in my region.

I added some cumin and extra salt! Good to go! Yum!! Great to make ahead for the week

I used to make this recipe all the time in college 20 years ago. It was cheap and delicious. I remember melting smoked Gouda over the leftovers. What good times.

Delicious! I did add 1 tsp cumin and an extra clove of garlic. I also made come morning star chorizo fake ground beef on the side, which was amazing when mixed in with the rice.

Nice recipe and easy to make.

I've been making this recipe for years now. It's one I serve at least once a month. I make no changes, other than sometimes using black beans.

I used 2 tsp  sazon seasoning in place of the salt and other spices. Will definitely make this again - it was a hit!

added a can of diced tomatoes
