Great flavor, tho' I used 2/3 onion. maybe use more egg for tighter smoother pate?

8.7.21 This is the easiest pate I've ever made with everything going into the food processor and then poured into small loaf pans to cook (it makes a lot).   Baked one pan and put the other two in the freezer uncooked in accordance with the recipe submitter’s note.   I cooked for 50 minutes,  it didn’t quite feel done in the center, so added another 10 minutes for a total of 1 hour.  The consistency was just about perfect, firm enough to slice but easy enough to spread.  Next time,  I’ll increase the salt and nutmeg a little, but I’ll also add a bit of dry sherry.  Made yesterday, and served for lunch today with a garnish of chopped red onion and hard boiled eggs.  This one’s a keeper if you’re a lover of chicken liver pate.  Thanks for submitting your recipe.
