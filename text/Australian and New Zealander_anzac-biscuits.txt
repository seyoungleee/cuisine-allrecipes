I've made this recipe a few times now and I love it. The batter is a bit loose so be sure to press each cookie down slightly just to even it out. I've used chocolate chips or butterscotch chips and they're both great. It works with raisins or cranberries and even dried cherries.

super easy and tasty

If I had been baking Florentines I would have been thrilled! these cookies spread out so much and were thin as pancakes. What did I do wrong? Double checked the recipe several times -I think too much butterâ€¦?

Biscuits came out very greasy. Will try a little more flour next time, and brown sugar instead of white sugar.

If you prefer a more chewy biscuit like me, substitute the white sugar for brown sugar. Great recipie!
