Loved this recipe!   Gluten free, a carb we can eat AND it makes a delightful & handy little bread.    I've already made a 2nd batch and rolled out tennis-ball-sized pizza shells.   Baked them until starting to brown, added toppings and WOW.   The BEST gluten free pizza EVER - crispy and definitely able to handle tomato sauce, piles of cheese and pepperoni. THANK YOU.

After trying a similar roll at a Whole Foods sample day, I pleased to find this GF recipe. Used coconut milk instead of dairy, next time will try dairy. Cooked full 20 minutes, made closer to 30 rolls.

This recipe is soooo good and easy to prepare. The cheese rolls are fluffy and delicious!

This is so much better than those ready made mixes that are out there.  I recommend using a mixer for sure.  I used 8 oz of block Parmesan cheese instead of 6 oz to increase flavor and because block Parmesan cheese is sold in 8 oz, not 6 oz.  I used a nutribullet to turn the cheese into a flour to make it easier to mix with the tapioca flour (aka tapioca starch) as shredded cheese doesn't mix as well.  I used Bob's Red Mill brand tapioca flour.

Loved these!I substituted Romano cheese for the parmesan, and they come out perfectly.I did cook for the full 20 minutes.

Loved it. So easy and delicious. Used part Asiago cheese.. yum!

Best cheese bread ever! I had them with cheddar cheese instead of parmigiana cheese

It is so delicious!

Exactly same taste as I used to it in Brazil! Love it!

This recipe turned out great for me! However, I find that the end product will be much better if you use a mixer to emulsify all your ingredients together well (Before AND after adding the eggs) as the oil tends to seep out of the mix. Similar to how you would make pate a choux. Taste, texture & appearance was awesome.

the taste was great just like at a Brazillian restaurant, but the shape did not match, have now made 2 times, love them.
