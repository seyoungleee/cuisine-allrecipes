I've never made a recipe like this before, so was excited to try something new! There was no whole tilapia at the market where I get my fish, so I opted for a big fresh piece of cod. My fillet was over 1.5lbs so I cut it into 4 pieces and fried two at a time. There was no skin so some of the fish broke up in the oil, but I was able to save all the pieces and have plenty of fish for dinner for two with some leftover. I'm wondering if the 4oz tilapia is a typo since the recipe made more than enough sauce for my 1.5lbs of fish? The only other note I would make to this recipe is to mix the cornstarch with cold water to create a slurry, since when I added the cornstarch directly to the sauce mixture clumps formed immediately. The sweet and sour flavors definitely came through and the fresh ginger really made it pop. I'm excited to try this recipe again with different fish!
