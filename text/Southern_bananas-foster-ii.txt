Awesome!!!....and so simple.  Be sure to only "warm" the bananas in the sauce, otherwise bananas wil be too mushy.

Made this recipe for myself and my parents...I would recommend twice the amount of walnuts and to make sure the sugar actually dissolves, otherwise instead of a caramel-type sauce, it's grainy. It's a very sweet recipe, reducing the amount of sugar may help as well. Using bananas that aren't fully ripe adds a touch of acidity that was very welcome in this sugary dish.

tasted amazing

Excellent recipe. I used Hawaiian apple bananas, they are not as sweet and have little acidity. Also I had in fridge some figs so I added them in. Good combination.

Yum

Made it as a bbq dessert using the left over heat from the coals. Worked beautifully & was absolutely delicious. Will definitely do again.

it tastes delicious but it is neither flambeed nor bruleed so it wasn’t exactky what i was looking for…

Soooo good!!! A family favorite! & So easy to make!

I’m this is my go to brunch recipe and it’s delicious. I can’t believe it took so long to rate it but I’ve been using it for ages. I usually just omit the walnuts because I don’t like them. I made the last round with vanilla infused bourbon and it was amazing.

I had no rum so I used Cointreau. Awesome flavor!  I also flambéed it for fx.

Great recipe. Only change I made was Candied pecans instead of walnuts try it it’s phenomenal
