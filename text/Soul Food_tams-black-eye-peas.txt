I left out the hot beef link sausage and used dried peas.  This was awesome.  The smoked turkey leg gave a far superior flavor than my usual  smoked ham  hock.  Will make this my standard recipe for black-eyed peas.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!I used the same exact ingredients except I used my pressure cooker, sautéed the onions and sausage first, then everything else in the pot for 35 minutes.

Two things. First, have never eaten or made black eyed peas before, and second, I have never made a pot of beans, stew, or anything that I have not had to “tweak” or add my personal touch to. This recipe is soooo delicious and required zero tweaking! I made it exactly as the recipe stated and while I’ve never had black eyed peas before, I have made plenty of beans and pea soups and recognize that the flavor profile created from the smoked Turkey is better in my opinion than any ham hock I’ve ever used. 5 stars all the way!

Followed the recipe exactly except for the spicy sausage....omitted that and used smoked turkey wings instead of legs. Came out fantastic! Huge hit! Will definitely be a staple at my house from now on.

I’m a Southern cook. I used a ham bone instead of the meat called for in recipe. Also used dried peas. Fresh garlic and honey instead of sugar. Cooked low and slow for hours. Excellent.

I was raised cooking with my grandma and I never cooked black eyed peas and I added some extra ingredients and they turned out tasty!

made these peas today for the great start 2020 love them

Was excellent just added some Sazon!!!

I make this all the time.  It is an excellent meal.

Love this recipe. It really simple and turns out just like my mom's.
