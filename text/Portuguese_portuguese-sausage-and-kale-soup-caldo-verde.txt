This was absolutely delicious.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and glad I didn't.
We had fresh kale from the garden and everyone enjoyed it so much they have already asked me to make it again.

I absolutely loved this recipe, I did add in some diced celery.  This is a nice filling comfort food recipe.  You can use spinach in place of the kale as well!
