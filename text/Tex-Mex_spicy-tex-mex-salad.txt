Very tasty. The salad complemented the mexican meal I made very well. I just wish it had held up a little longer once the chips and dressing were added. If Captain Crunch can stay crunchy, even after adding milk, it is too bad that someone can't design a chip that can stay crunchy after adding dressing!

I didn't think this recipe was bad, just not great.  I wouldn't make this again, only because the flavor combination was strange to me, and didn't pair particularly well with the tacos I served it with.  I would suggest using a little less salad dressing, as I found the mix to be soggy.

Added half a sweet onion and orange sweet pepper

This taco salad is a nice meatless option for a summer weeknight. I added some finely chopped green onions - added flavor. Next time I will add avocado. You can adjust ingredients and amounts to accommodate your tastes. I also added only as much dressing as seemed good to me. It was about 1/3 of the bottle.

ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL IT TASTES SO GOOD

I would add the dressing on the side so it wouldn't get soggy and you could have better leftovers.  (chips on the side too)

This recipe was easy and delicious and will be making it again and again...A keeper for sure...

Awesome

This is missing taco seasoning mix. We add taco seasoning mix to taste. Makes this 100% better!

I wasn't impressed w/ this because  1) the catalina dressing was too sweet for this and 2) got soggy real quick.

Enjoyed the combination of ingredients a easy salad to make and can be change to one chooses.
