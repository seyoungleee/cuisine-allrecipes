I've only tried oxtail once before and it was a small bite but thought it was good. When I saw it in the store I said why not? This is by far one of the best dishes I've ever made and will surely make it again!!

Tried it for my Cubanese week and it was delicious! Will use that recipe again!I added rosties instead of rice.

Crowd pleaser for sure

I'm used to my mother's and my sister's Rabo encendido; we are Dominican so they made it a little different than Cuban style.  I did add some of the things I've seen my mother and sister add to theirs.  It came out delicious!!!  We Loved It!!!

I really enjoyed this dish. My wife loves ordering this when we eat at Cuban restaurants and she asked me to make it. I followed recipe closely, but added more potatoes, carrots and garlic. Couldn’t find the Miami style sazón, but used more of the other. With some black beans and rice you will enjoy an authentic and delicious Cuban meal.

I am glad you all liked it as it’s a family recipe that’s been in my family for 30 years plus. You can also add hot sauce to make it hot ! Thats how I make it for the Firehouse!! You can also make it in Jamaican Jerk seasoning which is amazingly delicious as well.
