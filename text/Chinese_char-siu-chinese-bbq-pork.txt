I like this recipe and have made it three times, with modifications the second and third time. Some observations: Chinese use pork butt for Char Siu because we love the fat and it really is part and parcel to the authentic dish. That said, I used tenderloin the first time, pork sirloin roast the second, and pork shoulder the last. The latter/fatter cut was better in flavor and juiciness, but of course, less healthy.

I do like pretty red colored char siu but against my better judgement, I used the full 2 tablespoons of food color which was huge overkill.  I went with 1 tablespoon the second time and it was still way too much and stained my cutting board. Food coloring is terrible for our bodies so cut it way back, or not at all, or as suggested, substitute red bean paste or boil down some beets if you want it red. 

I also like five spice, but take care how much you use. It will overpower all other ingredients. I suggest 1/2 teaspoon or less.
Reserve 1/2 cup of the marinade for non-cross contaminated basting before you bag up the meat, and marinate it no less than overnight. It needs to be in the soup that long to penetrate. Don't cook it for an hour or you'll overcook. Use a thermometer and pull it at 145 degrees and let it rest. The water pan is a good suggestion if you are using leaner cuts. A whole butt roast makes a lot, so I portion it up and freeze pieces for later use. I just made 
Char Siu, doufu, fan (BBQ pork tofu over rice) using bean paste as the main seasoning f

Not sure what went wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted cooking sherry for rice wine do to no availability and cooked in the oven as it's winter in Ak and grilling was not an option.  I marinated two pork tenderloins and cooked the first one after two hours in the marinade.  It wasn't very good and the flavor tasted way off.  So I let the second tenderloin marinate over night thinking maybe that would help.  It was even worse.  I usually like homemade asian recipes and I love bbq pork so not sure where this recipe went wrong as others seemed to really like it.  We will not make again.

Cook the raw marinade gently to reduce it & drizzle over your pork/noodles/stir fry/rice/etc..SO much Sugar-I added Tabasco to cut through the sweetness (other hot sauces are available)

Delicious! Followed exact recipe including optional 5-spice seasoning. Did overnight marinade and outside grill on high with 4-minute sear for grill marks and then indirect heat with water pan. I used optional red food color (only 1/2 t) rather than red bean curd. Added sesame seeds. Served w/ vegetable fried rice. Meat was incredibly fork tender, sweet and sticky. Was best version I’ve ever had. Lots of great feedback..

Well so far, I was hungry when I looked this up, tasted the sauce and decided to marinate 1/2 and stir fry the other, mixed it with sugar snap peas, green onions and used sesame oil to fry it in, when I was done, I added a little extra sauce and it was great just like that I have yet to cook what is marinating.  I think this is my new go to pork roast recipe :)

Excellent!!! We slow cooked using Pork Tenderloins on the gas grill. Served with Jasmin rice and 'Chinese Buffet' Green Beans. Only modification was to the Green beans, we only used 1/2 of the recommended sugar.

Good recipe. But do not baste with a marinade used for raw meat. Make up extra and set to the side. Or cook the remaining sauce from the bag. Place in saucepan with 1/2c of water and reduce.

I made this recipe years ago. My mom would take us to a store called Crown and I've never forgotten that flavor. Can't wait to make it again 😛

As a Chinese, it tasted just like home.😋🏡😋🏡😋🏡😋🏡😋🏡😋🏡😋🏡

First time I made, didn’t have five spice so ground one star anise and added a bit of cinnamon. Used five spice second time. Both delicious. I decided to smoke a pork butt. Put onion snd garlic powder as a rub then used gloves to cost the sauce all over it. Flipped once in 9 hours. Freakishly delicious! Used rice wine to spray occasionally and kept some water in pot in smoker. Added more sauce once shredded. Yummy!

So, I made this on a whim and I didn't have all the ingredients. Still, it was excellent!  I happened to use red wine for the rice wine, and no bean curd, and agave syrup for the honey.  I marinated it 24 hours, with the tenderloin cut up into 3" wide chunks.  Wow!  I baked it at 350 degrees for 40 minutes - flipping the pieces after 20 minutes.  I did place them on a rack - which I normally do anyway - and poured a cup of water into the baking pan.  I have used NOH chinese barbecued pork packages for 40 + years.  This is better!
