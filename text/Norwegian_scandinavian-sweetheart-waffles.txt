This recipe turned out delicious! I am not one for thick belgian waffles, and these thinner Scandinavian waffles are a better, healthier alternative. I did not have any vanilla sugar, so I simply substituted vanilla extract. Definitely keeping this one in mind for future breakfasts!

I've had a Swedish Waffle recipe that called for whipped egg whites for 30 years. Always got compliments. Tried this recipe this morning and it was next level batter errr better. I don't think that buttermilk is a thing there and was more than likely a Norwegian version of Fil Mjolk. Which is available in the states now under the brand name Siggis. The cardamom was a great secret ingredient. Thanks for sharing.

I make these with whole wheat flour and skip the Cardomom. Also, if I make extras, I interleave them with parchment paper and freeze. Simple toasting makes them almost as good as fresh.... Great for quick breakfasts.

Delicious.
Note: the "leavening" comes from whipping lots of air into your egg whites, then folding them gently into the rest of the batter. And these will work best in a Scandanavian waffle iron, rather than a Belgian / Anerican waffle iron.
Yum.

Love these waffles!  Very light and fluffy. I doubled the cardamom and served them with berries.

Slightly sweet and perfect for no syrup mornings! I left out the cardamom since I was making them for my toddler.

Tasted like a waffle cone and didn't have that slight salty baking soda sour kind of taste that perfectly pairs opposite sweet syrup so no, did not like it. Followed the recipe exactly.

Good!  Only made three waffles though, so unless there only three of you...  Also could try doubling the recipe.

Not sure where I went wrong but it seemed like there was too much flour which made the waffle a bit drier and almost gritty. Will try this recipe again with small tweaks

Best ever waffles!
