The marinade and sauce were great! I used boneless skinless thighs cooked about 5 mins per side. I was expecting the sauce to be very spicy but it wasn't which was great for me since I can't handle much spice. If you like spicier foods you might want to add another jalapeno or hot sauce.

So, so good. The chicken is great. I bake instead of grill for ease and I double the green sauce and pour over rice as well as the chicken. Though I love the chicken, it's really just a delicious vehicle for that green sauce.

This dish is EVERYTHING!! From the marinade to the delicious green sauce is was absolute chefs kiss. Will be making it all summer long.

This is a fantastic recipe. We've made it several times. Double (or triple) the sauce recipe... you'll want more, especially if you serve this with grilled vegetables and rice!

I have made it twice now.  It quickly became one of my families favorites.

Awesome!

Fantastically tasty. This is a good recipe to prepare on Sunday to cook during the week. Turned out like the picture. Thanks for sharing!

Wow...This is excellent! I made as directed except I marinated the chicken overnight and for the sauce, I used the entire bunch of cilantro because we love the stuff. Oh, just as I was going to start the grill, it started raining so decided to fry the thighs but hope to grill them next time. Delicious. Will make again.
