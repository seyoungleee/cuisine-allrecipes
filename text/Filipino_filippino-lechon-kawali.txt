Instead of room temp, u can actually place it in the ref for about 30-1hr. When you fry it, it will be really crispy! This is one of the sinful yummy foods you'll ever taste

Just made this. I loved the yummy aroma it made but was a little disappointed because it didn't turned as crispy as I expected it to be.  The other commenter was right, I should've refrigerated first before frying.  Also, the flavor was a bit bland. Had to add an extra dash of garlic salt and pepper after frying.

We thought this was really good.  I'm going to do it again but add more flavor & seasonings to the water boil but they were great as is.

This was good, but the oil popped a lot kinda scary.  Made sauce vinegar and soy sauce with garlic.  I will make this again.  Guess I need to refrigerate longer

This was very easy to make. It turned out perfect!

Tasted Great! This is my wife's favorite from home! Very easy to make. And more importantly, my wife LOVED IT!

My girlfriend and I made this for Thanksgiving with her family.

It's been a while since I've eaten lechon kawali! This was a nice easy recipe to make
