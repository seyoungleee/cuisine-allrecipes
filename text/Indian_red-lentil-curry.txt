I have never sent a review for any recipe that I have tried. But, this recipe deserves one! It is excellent.  I used fresh tomatoes and then put them  into the caramelized onions. I also simmered all the spices together in a little oil, as taught to me by an Indian cook.  Then, tossed in the garlic and ginger; continued for about 1 more minute. Afterwards, I put the tomato and onions into the spice mix.  Then, added the lentils...  AWESOME!

This will be much better the next time I make it.  I over cooked the lentils.  They were very mushy.  Next time I will check them after 10 minutes.  Our family is new to vegan life style, so it's trial and error going forth.  This is a great start.

Delicious and very easy. I served with basmatti rice. I didn't have tomato puree so used a small can of diced tomatoes.  LOVED IT!

Wonderful. Made to recipe, it was very dry, I added broth to make it more moist. Will definitely put on my favorite folder.

great!  Like resturants

Been making Indian Restaurant style curries for years but never got round to a lentil curry. Recipe is Ok but as a dish, it needs some added interest like large chopped peppers/onions/cauliflower and perhaps some beans or chickpeas. Lentils on their own is a bit boring.

DeeLISH! This is the second time I've made this dish. However, it takes this cook WAY more than 10 minutes to prep.

Really easy and delicious!

Very yummy!!! Will make again!!!

Use full bottle of tomato pur√©e

Made this as written, used 3 cloves garlic,  a can of diced tomatoes in garlic, basil oregano (smoothed in blender), instead of puree. It was awesome! Quick, easy, delicious, and healthy! I will do this with some added shrimp and diced jalapenos next time.
