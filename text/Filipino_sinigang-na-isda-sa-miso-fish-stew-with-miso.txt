Had to leave out the daikon because I didn't have one and I used sole instead of snapper and kale instead of mustard greens (and just a little bit of green chili). It was a success at my house anyway.

Awesome recipe! I used powdered tamarind soup base and kalamansi juice to give my “sinigang na salmon belly sa miso” that extra tang which my family loved!
