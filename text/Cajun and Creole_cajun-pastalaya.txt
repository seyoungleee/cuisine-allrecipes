Very good flavor! I doubled the recipe since I am freezing some and I used dried herbs.  I will use fresh herbs next time. 

I could not find a good conversion for 1 bunch of fresh herbs to dried. If anyone else used dried herbs, please comment on the amount you used. Since I doubled the recipe, I used 2 Tablespoons of each.

An amazing recipe - that makes a TON! But oh so delicious!! Used both red and green bell pepper, used homemade Creole Seasoning from this site (which has some heat) so I omitted the cayenne. The contributor confesses cook times might be off - and I agree. Took almost 12ish min for my pasta to be semi-cooked, and I had to add another 3/4c water halfway through.  To prevent shrimp from getting rubbery/over cooked - added when the pasta only had a few min left of cook time. Used dried herbs and a TSP each. Overall, this was a HUGE hit and both husband and I loved!  If you can be flexible with cook times - this, as written, is a FANTASTIC recipe!! Thanks for sharing!! For once, Iâ€™m excited for leftovers!!

Delicious, and a fun take on jambalaya. Quite a bit of prep, so do this when you have more time to cook.
