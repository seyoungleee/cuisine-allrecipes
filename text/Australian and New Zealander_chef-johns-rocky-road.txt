LOVE!!! SO EASY & QUICK!!

Added 1/4 t of Cayenne when stirring. Used pecans and the FunMallows - orange strawberry lemon and lime. 
A keeper. Very easy to do and great end result. Everyone thinks you spent hours on it. Thanks Chef.

Great recipe but be sure you really work fast to get the almonds and marshmallows in because the chocolate hardens quick but not sure if I did something wrong because my marshmallows started melting. The chocolate is too hot to work with right from the stove but too hard to work with if you let it cool a bit.

Chef John has done it again! This recipe is so easy and so delicious. I've done this with both walnuts and pecans (I don't keep almonds) and both versions were incredible. Only difference with mine was I didn't add the cocoa on top. This one is definitely a keeper!

This was really good to include in my homemade custard adding it was a tad bit hard but man homemade rocky road ice cream was delicious thank you for the rocky road recipe.
