This is excellent thank you for sharing! Much easier to make it than look for a store that sells it.

I made this yesterday! It was so good. Skipped the syrup on top and I used half a cup of water and a shot of rum instead of beer.

Amazing.  I' received so many rave reviews about this recipe. It turned out perfect. Thanks so much for sharing!

Very easy to make and delicious!!  Did not change a thing and it came out great.

This was awesome! Especially for my social studies project! Thanks for sharing!

My teenage son loves this recipe.  He asks me to make it over and over and over again.

Added walnuts and chopped cherries as well and it was absolutely delicious.

This recipe was a true hit. I made it on Easter. I'm not a baker but this bun came out moist, and authentic. If you put it in a large bunt pan you have to bake it for 2 hours. Great job Tanya!!

So delicious! Followed the recipe exactly but I put 1 1/4 cups of brown sugar by accident. Still tasted great!
