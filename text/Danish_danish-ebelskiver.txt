I usually need to add extra milk to thin down the batter.

Definitely a decent recipe, but I prefer my ebelskivers to be less dense and a bit lighter. I thought they would be with the whipped egg whites, but they were still pretty heavy. My hubby thought they were yummy and I did, too. Just not exactly what I was looking for. Also - the recipe makes WAY more than 7 pancakes. It's a huge amount of batter that would feed at least 5 people.

Great recipe. My people loved it. I reduced the cinnamon and filled with Nutella and some with blueberries! Delicious. I used a nonstick pan. I canâ€™t wait to see how the are tomorrow after reheating slightly!

I always but a dollop (about 1/2 tsp) of lingonberry jam in each one before turning and then sprinkle with powdered sugar when done.  This makes a great, very special Christmas morning breakfast.  I turn them gently with a chopstick. It's a bit more substantial than a toothpick or wooden skewer.  I think I'm going to try putting nutella in each one for a really decadent treat.

After moving, I'm still looking for some of my recipes including this one. I may have to resort to trying this recipe. Just thought I would note though, my Danish friend is the one who gave me the recipe and the pan and a very small crochet hook she used to turn them! These made the recipe much easier to handle. She also used a box cake mix when she was in a hurry, filling the bowls of the pan about 2/3 up. She then rolled in powdered or granulated sugar and served as desserts with coffee.

This was ok.  When they talk about a serving they must mean 6-7 of those little guys each serving. I halfed the recipe and it still made a lot.  Don't over fill the little bowls.  Don't get the pan to hot. I think this needs to be sweeter so I added peach jam in the center of each one. Some I did cooked apples. Then dust with power sugar. I need to find another use for this pan or I am going to get rid of it. This was a lot of work for an ok dish. Maybe an appetizer will be better.
