Delicious!  This uses a little more vinegar than other chimi recipes I have tried, but I loved that! A perfect balance of ingredients, no tweaking necessary. I served it over grilled steak, and I also stirred a little bit into my rice. So good! Definite keeper!

I made this twice. Once following the recipe and the second time I substituted lime juice instead of red wine vinegar. Both were excellent!

I use this recipe at least twice a month. It is so easy and always turns out great. I do add a few minor things but it is a great recipe to work off of so thank you for sharing it.

Super simple and extremely tasty.

Absolutely Great! The only change I made was to reduce red pepper to 1/2 tsp.
