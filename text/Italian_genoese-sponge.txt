Hey this recipe is great and it freezes well too.

I found that this recipe worked out really well; it needed a bit less cooking than suggested but the sponge was soft and light. I tried adding a bit of pur√©ed strawberries to the mix which worked well, but judging from other people's idea I might try strawberry liqueur next time.

I have not tried this one in particular, but, in defense of this recipe, genoise  is typically a dry cake.  This allows you to add extra flavor and moisture through a simple syrup flavored with any liquer or extract(thus, minimizing the egg taste)  You must keep the genoise covered and/or use quickly as it does dry out quickly.
