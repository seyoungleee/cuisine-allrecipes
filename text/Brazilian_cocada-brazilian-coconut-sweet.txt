These turned out perfect. The grandkids and I have been learning about South America.  We've made a cacoa drink, Galinhada for lunch and my 8 year old grandson made these by himself. Turned out perfect! Follow the directions.

This recipe was a total failure. It was wayyyy too sweet and extremely sticky. They stuck to the parchment paper so I froze them and was able to peel them off. I placed them on a plate and within minutes they had all clumped together. Waste of time and food.
