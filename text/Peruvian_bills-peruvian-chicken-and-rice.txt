My husband enjoyed this and my daughter LOVED it!  We all felt the rice was fine but nothing spectacular- the chicken however really made this dish something special!  This is definitely one I'll be making again.

Loved it!  Different flavor.  I didn't have white wine vinegar so used apple cider vinegar in place.  I used 1-1/4 TBL of reg paprika and 3/4 TBL of smoked paprika instead of just regular to give a slight dimension of smoky.  I used 1 med/large onion.  Cooking time stated is long and high temp for diced sized breast,  imo. Probably be good with thigh.   I'll adjust next time.  The rice was spot on tasty.  Looking forward to making it again!

Very tasty recipe, however I did swap out the rice for riced cauliflower to reduce the carbs.

My entire family loved this dish.  Very easy to make, my boys made the rice and it was delicious! We are excited to have found a new meal to have each week.

Followed the recipe to the letter and it was wonderful! So tasty; the rice on its own was very delicious and the chicken was tender and full of flavor. First time trying Peruvian recipes, and I am hooked. I thought the cumin might be too much, but it was just right. Definitely a keeper.

I liked it

used the marinade w/ onions on thinly sliced chicken breast, put it on the  grill pan.  Turned out delicious with Trader Joe's frozen Peruvian Rice.

Sadly we didn’t care for the sauce but loved the rice which I prepared in my rice cooker.

I have always been too intimidated to cook pollo a la brasa for my Peruvian husband, but I tried this and it’s amazing!  I love that it’s easy.  Thanks, Bill!

So delicious and very easy!!!
