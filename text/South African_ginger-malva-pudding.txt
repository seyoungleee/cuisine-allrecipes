Everything came out perfect....... Used less sugar as there is a diabetic in the house. Not very confident in the sauce

This is a great base recipe. I made quite a few alterations. I reduced the amount of ginger, reduced the temperature to 350 and cooked it longer. I also used an 8x8 pan as that was all I had on hand. I also cooked the sauce for a significantly longer time and reduced to the point that it was the texture of cake batter. Great dish.

Despite my mistakes, this recipe came out very well. only problem was the sauce was too watery. next time I will leave out the water when making the sauce
