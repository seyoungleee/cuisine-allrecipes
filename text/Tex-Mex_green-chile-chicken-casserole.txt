This is a delicious dish. We used actual frozen Hatch chili's and tomatillos. Will make this dish again.

I thought this lonely recipe needed more reviews so here it is.. This was so good! What a nice weeknight meal, full of flavor.. I agree with the other reviewer, don’t change a thing! Except maybe more cheese if you like ooooey goooey, personally I like A LOT of cheese but still delicious as written.. thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe.  Excellent directions.  Don’t change a thing and enjoy.
