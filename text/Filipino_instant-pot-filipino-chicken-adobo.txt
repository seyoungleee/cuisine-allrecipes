Loved it! My husband is Filipino and had 2 servings. I cooked on high pressure for 10 minutes and quick released pressure which took less than 5 minutes. I didn’t have thighs, so I used large chicken breasts and cut into thirds. I didn’t have peppercorns, and used 3/4 tsp ground pepper. Next time I’ll use 1/2 tsp. I also doubled the garlic because Filipino’s love garlic. Definitely will make again.

I’ve made adobo the traditional way (recipe from some Filipino Carmelite nuns at our parish). Sorry, Sr. Stella, this is great! I think the best feature is crisping the skin under the broiler.  I modified the recipe a bit. Extra 1/4 cup of liquid to ensure against a burn warning (maybe being overly cautious, burn notices are annoying) and I used a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end. If you want a delicious adobo done quickly this recipe is a keeper!

A bit too tangy but good and easy. I added extra brown sugar to taste.

This recipe is poorly written and unclear in parts.  Flavor pretty good.  I guess it’s just frustrating to try and read a recipe that has question marks.

My husband served his mission in the Philippines and really liked it

Easy and so delicious

Really enjoy this recipe, I've made it several times now and it's always popular.
Most of the recipes on this website I end up making some minor adjustments in seasoning or cook time, this is one of the few recipes that I can follow to the letter, and it's perfect every time. It's quick, it's cheap, (assuming you have an instant pot) and well balanced. Absolutely recommend.

This recipe is easy and delicious. Next time I'll season the chicken before I cooked it because it was a little blend. The sauce was really good.  I used boneless chicken thighs.

Was my first time making Adobo Chicken was straight forward recipe. Everyone liked.

really good! will make again!
