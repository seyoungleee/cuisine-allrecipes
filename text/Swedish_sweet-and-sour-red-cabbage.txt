Good, I leave out the caraway seeds, no one in my family will touch them. I also used bacon grease instead of butter and left the bacon pieces in. I also don't boil the cabbage, I just let it cook in the vinegar/sugar mixture until crisp tender.

Too much vinegar, even though Ann liked it.

Loved it!  Easy to make and so  very tasteful.

I did not use caraway seeds. My family liked this recipe.

Not sweet , not sour. Needs salt and pepper

9.22.20  I’ve made a good number of red cabbage recipes on this site, and the cooking method on this one is totally different.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and for our personal taste, it needs less brown sugar and butter, and more vinegar.  The thing that I missed more than anything was that tangy pop of tartness you typically get with red cabbage.  I have to wonder if that’s in part due to the fact that you’re merely stirring in vinegar at the end instead of cooking the cabbage in it.  We liked it well enough, but it’s not our favorite red cabbage recipe on this site.

Perfect copycat. Dough is meant to be sticky.

This recipe was so delicious. I made this dish to accompany mashed potatoes and chicken. I did not have caraway seeds and used fresh nutmeg.  My brother who is not a vegetable eater, loved it and returned for several helpings. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I loved this. I used green cabbage, that’s all I had. I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. It was excellent. Don’t be put off by the amount of caraway, once this is cooked, it’s quite subtle.

I love sweet and sour foods and red cabbage is very high on my list, I did add Onions and Apple slices.  It is so good I eat it as a snack without other foods.

Really good! I used less butter, and also added in some spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger with the brown sugar. Soooo yummy!
