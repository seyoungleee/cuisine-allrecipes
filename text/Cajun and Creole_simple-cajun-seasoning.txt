I needed cajun seasoning for a recipe and whipped this up in no time at all! I loved it as is, but it's very spicy (it IS CAJUN sesoning, after all). The nice thing about making your own is you can control and spice/salt in the seasoning!

From a native of New Orleans, this would be perfect if it had garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt and white pepper.  Also, replace the oregano with sage. Just a suggestion.

Thank you sharing this recipe!It was a little salt-foward for my taste, but I just doubled up on everything else, and now I have more for next time .I also added garlic and onion powder per a suggestion I saw in the reviews....I'm excited for Cajun chicken, Cajun pasta ...  Yay!

I made this seasoning yesterday for a chicken recipe that called for Cajun seasoning. It turned out spicy but not hot. I thought it was just right and I’d make it again!

Great cajun seasoning made with what I always have on hand. I added a tablespoon of garlic powder and a tablespoon of onion powder. I also used smoked paprika instead of regular, just to give it a little something something. I do have to say - definitely cut the amount of salt by half. I love my good salty and this was still way too much for me. Otherwise, nice.

Made with omission of salt-

I added a TBSP each of Garlic Powder and Onion Powder along with a smidge of homegrown dried sage. Excellent!

Excellent mix of spices making it very easy to spice up a recipe.

This is an amazing Cajun spice I use it on everything- chicken, steak and especially shrimp. It’s the only spice I actually take the time to make. The store bought ones are not comparable.

Made this to season chicken breast that was going on top of a mixed green Caesar salad. So good!

I have made this twice now and it is a wonderful and quick mix. Thank you for sharing this!
