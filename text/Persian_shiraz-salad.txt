This "Shiraz Salad" is ubiquitous in Iran where it is called "Salad Shirazi" and served in personal portions in tiny bowls (less that 4 oz). The trick to making this salad authentic is the dice on the tomatoes and cucumbers. Iranians eat with a fork and a spoon (no knife): The dice on the vegetables must be fine (like peas) to make it easy to eat. A good substitute for the lemon juice is "ob gureh" (a type of vinegar available at the Iranian grocery store - easy to keep on hand). If you use dried mint instead of fresh mint, rub it between your fingers to powder it. Thank you Marianne for sharing your recipe.

4.11.17   I don't believe I've eaten any Persian meal, but that doesn't matter because this salad is a good accompaniment to just about ANY meal.  Quick to make with bright, fresh flavor, and you can eat your heart out guilt-free.
