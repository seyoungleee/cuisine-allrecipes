This was easy and delicious (and very healthy too)!  The only change I made was to use dill instead of the parsley.  I will definitely make this again!

This was my first time making tzatziki sauce and I'm pleased to say it was a huge hit with the family! Next time I'm going to try dill instead of parsley (I'm a dill fan) but this recipe as written is on point. Thanks for submitting it!

Easy and very tasty

Very basic, quick and easy. I added a bit of olive oil, oregano and lemon juice to give a tastier smoother texture.

added
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
½ lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill

Awesome and so simple! In place of parsley, I added about 2 teaspoons of dried full weed. The dill added a whole new level of flavour!

I had all of the ingredients on hand.  Tasted delicious with my Trader Joes Falafel.  I would make again.

Fast and so easy. I make my own yogurt so it was a matter of just adding the rest of the ingredients. Much better than store bought.

Excellent and easy! I used garlic powder with parsley instead of fresh garlic (didn’t have any) and added some lemon juice and dill. I also drained the cucumbers in a colander with paper towels before adding to the yogurt mix. Added a bit of black pepper too! It makes quite a bit of sauce but it’s great with pita, pita chips and chicken gyros!

Used sour cream (no time to run to store!).
