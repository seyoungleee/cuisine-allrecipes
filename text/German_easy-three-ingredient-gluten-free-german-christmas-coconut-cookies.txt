I had sweetened coconut flakes so I just omitted the sugar. The timing and temperature on this was perfect! My friends loved it and so did I.

So easy! So fast! Makes a big batch and they are delicious! I was unsure what the texture would be like. Mine came out chewy on the outside and soft, moist and fluffy on the inside. YUM!

These are so yummy, my mom and I ate about half of them as they came pit of the oven.
