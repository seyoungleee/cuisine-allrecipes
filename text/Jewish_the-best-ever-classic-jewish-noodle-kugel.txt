Exactly what I was looking for! Sweet, creamy, with a nice vanilla flavor. I sometimes add raisins. You can decrease the sugar if desired to 1/2 cup and it's still great.

not bad. This is compared to a favorite recipe from an experienced Jewish caterer though, not sure if it's fair.  I really would take the time to use fresh grated apples in place of the applesauce though.

Wow - I was not sure about this because it was different from the one I grew up eating. We loved this recipe! I have a dairy allergy, so it was a joy to have such a delicious kugel! I did use 5 eggs and a little extra dairy-free butter. I mixed  cinnamon in as well as put some on top. I baked it in a large casserole dish instead of a 9x13 pan. So good! This is my new kugel recipe! I will make this again and might try adding the raisins or other fruit.

This recipe is delicious, and so easy! Everyone raved about it. I followed the recipe exactly and at the last minute sprinkled and mixed a little cinnamon in the mixture before pouring in the pan. Thank you - this is a definite keeper!

Simple and perfect. Impossible to mess up.

I made this and added raisin and canned pineapple. came out great.

Just like my mother made, I add pineapple chunks and raisins like she did. Also gluten free because I'm gluten free now. A great parve kogel

Amazing! My husband is obsessed and its soooooo easy

Since reading all the mostly great reviews I am simply making my remark as not so good-mine was very dry followed exactly and was looking  to having a taste. I would have loved mine to turn out as others attested to a very tasteful dish.

Liked the flavour, but the pasta was a bit too crispy.

This was delicious. I added an extra egg, used 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup raisins and added one teaspoon of cinnamon to the recipe. Came out amazing. My husband loves it and keeps giving me praise every time he eats it. Thanks!
