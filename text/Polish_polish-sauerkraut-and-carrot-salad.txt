I added a tiny bit of maple syrup. Excellent recipe.

It was good but next time I might add some celery seed to boost the flavor a bit.

Delicious

Definitely must try this.  My family loves everything in this, and I've had something similar before.  Don't be afraid to try something new.  If you like the basic ingredients, there's a good chance you will really like it.  And it's good for you!
