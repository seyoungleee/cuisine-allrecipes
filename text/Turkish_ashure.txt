ok so the day of ashure is coming up this week and since i have never made ashure because my mom or aunt or sister in law makes it i decided to give it a try>>>>>it was very yummy....i have never had this with orange peel so it was a nice touch. I garnished it with pomegranite seeds and ground hazelnuts>>>very good! YOU can also make this with green grapes instead of raisins and also dried figs. Thank you aslicik!

easy-to-follow recipe.I added rosewater in the end when the Ashure got thick and used cashew nuts and pomegranate for garnishing

very nice recipe. I live in the US and wanted to make ashure. I love it. So, I was looking for the ingredients, found them online. Now I can cook more Turkish dishes. I am psyched!

bravo sana!!ben de surekli yapiyorummm..kolay gelsin :))))*all in all a good one!*
