Good recipe for pot luck vegetarian setting. Made in instant pot.  I found that the garbanzo beans needed more time than the other beans ( kidney and black beans ) , so the latter got a little over cooked .  Next time would soak the garbanzos to give them head start .  Also would add some more liquids as mine scorched on bottom as well.

The recipe was delicious. In the future, I would add more broth and/or salsa to the pot. It was a bit dry for my taste and also started to scorch on the bottom of the Instant Pot. Would definitely recommend this recipe!

My family loved this and it was super easy to make. I made it exactly as written and the flavors were great. I'd add more taco seasoning next time.
