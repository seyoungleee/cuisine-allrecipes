Great recipe. This is our 2nd year making eggs using this recipe. Our eggs have turned out absolutely beautiful! They had such an amazing color! We did cut back the time of cooking the eggs to 10 mins, and then let them finish in the water., because it stays hot for a while. Thanks for sharing.

Good recipe. I made with yellow and red onion skins I had saved since October. I'm pleased with the deep color. I don't exactly the amount of skins I used, since I save them in a gallon baggie until full. I did 30 eggs and used 6 tbs vinegar.

This is fantastic!  Second year making them.  I save onion skins all year, wrapping in a plastic bag in the freezer.  Then after making them, place in Easter egg braids.  Beautiful!!!

I wondered how deep the color would be; it is a deep terra cotta color, very pretty. My eggs are a little overdone, but that's not a surprise! I would try these again.
