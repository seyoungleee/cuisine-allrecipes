My family gobbled these up very quickly, these are the best waffles I've served them so far (I make them often). I'm sticking with this recipe!
Thank you for sharing it!!
By the way, I did alter a little by adding a bit more milk to get the batter to the consistency that I wanted, the original recipe was to thick to be poured into the waffle iron

Best waffles I’ve made!

Crispy and tasty!   The best waffle recipe I have tried over my 50 years of cooking.

I normally try to pick recipes with tons of reviews and at least 4.5 stars, but my gut told me to give this one, with only 17 reviews, a try.
It is great! I followed the recipe without altercation. 
I had read a review that there was too much vanilla and after making the batter, the smell of vanilla was stronger than I thought it should be and I was becoming worried, but after making the waffles it was not too strong.
I highly recommend this recipe. I will use this every time I want waffles.

I made as written, and to me they are better than the National Brand we know of here in the U.S. Worthy of 5 stars in my opinion! Thanks for sharing!

The texture was absolutely perfect, but the flavor was a little bland. I’m not sure what to add next time to make it taste a little better. Love the texture though, crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside. I’ve been looking for a waffle like this.

Perfect, yummy waffles

These were the best waffles I’ve ever had! No need to substitute anything or look elsewhere for another recipe. Just fantastic!

Perfect waffle!  Crunchy outside with soft tender center.  I made mine in a Belgium waffle maker.  Followed the recipe exactly as written.

I make it exactly as written, although I always have to triple or even quadruple the recipe since we love it so much! It’s always light and fluffy, so moist and flavourful. Keeps well in the fridge if you do have leftovers
