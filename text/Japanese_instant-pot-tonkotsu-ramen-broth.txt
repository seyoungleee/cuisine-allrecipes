This is what I was looking for. Instructions on how to convert the 12 hour stovetop recipe into a much shorter amount of time using the IP. I'm not following the recipe here except for the IP instructions. Thanks for providing those so I can replicate my favorite restaurant ramen!

This is a recipe for brown pork stock using Western cooking methods not how tonkotsu "soup" is typically made.It's okay to use pressure cookers/instant pot to save time instead of boiling pork bones for several hours to extract fat and breaking down collagen. But adding aromatics at the beginning and browning it even? You won't get that distinct creamy white paitan that tonkotsu is known for.Such a dull and inferior recipe with scant seasonings added here and there, lacking umami.Ramen broth starts out unseasoned so find a great tare recipe and also for aroma oil to flavor it when assembling a bowl.Also add some MSG to liven it up as what most ramen restaurants commonly practice.

Adding my first AR review to say this is a great recipe! Be aware that when it comes out of the Instant Pot, the broth won't have much flavour - but that's because there's no salt or seasoning involved yet. Adding the dashi, miso, soy etc brings it to life. Delicious!

Was not a fan of this. I've tried many times over the years to make broth in a pressure cooker and it never turns out well. Followed the recipe to a t and the broth tasted like slightly flavored water.

This recipe is amazing!! I really wanted to find a nice ramen recipe and this is it. I've made it the last 3 weekends and it never disappoints. It reheats beautifully and goes really well with some pork belly on top! Thank you so much!

It was delicious and a big hit with the family! The broth was flavorful but not overly salty.
