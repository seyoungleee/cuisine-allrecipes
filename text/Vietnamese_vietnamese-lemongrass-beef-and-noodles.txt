Loved it! I served the noodles hot, but otherwise followed the recipe.... Definitely a new fave!

I loved it. It turned out amazing and tasty.

I served the noodles hot, but really enjoyed it.  Easy to make.  Served it with roasted asparagus.

Both my husband and I agreed, that this one is a "do again". I did make a couple of modifications to the sauce. It was a bit too salty at first, so I added a bit more water, and about another tablespoon of sugar, and then the juice of a lime. We prefer lime with our Vietnamese food, as opposed to lemon. I also added a bit of carrot and cucumber to our bowls, to give it a bit more color. The meat is delicious! This would make a nice cool salad on a hot summer day. The amount of bean sprouts called for in this published version of the recipe is not correct. We like to just serve a handful of sprouts, Thai basil, cilantro and lime wedges on a platter, and let everyone add what they want to their bowls. That is how they serve it at one of our favorite Vietnamese restaurants. Thanks for sharing the recipe! Will make again!
